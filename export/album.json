The album won the 1986 Grammy Award for Album of the Year, while the title song won the 1987 Grammy for Record of the Year. In 2007, the album was added to the United States National Recording Registry, along with another 24 significant recordings that year. It is included in many \"best of\" and \"greatest\" album lists including both Rolling Stone's and Time's.\nComing at a time when Simon's musical career was at something of a low ebb following the disappointing public response to Hearts and Bones, the project was originally inspired by Simon's listening to a cassette of the Boyoyo Boys instrumental \"Gumboots\", lent to him by Heidi Berg, a singer-songwriter with whom Simon was working (and who would later become an award-winning jingle singer and writer). Simon later wrote lyrics to sing over a re-recording of the song, which became the fourth track on the album.\nGraceland features an eclectic mixture of musical styles including pop, a cappella, isicathamiya, rock, and mbaqanga.

The Dark Side of the Moon's themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.\r\nThe suite was developed during live performances and was premiered several months before studio recording began. The new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London.

The album contains some of their most famous songs, including the title track, with its distinct, instantly recognisable opening chord, and the previously released &quot;Can&#39;t Buy Me Love&quot;; both were transatlantic number-one singles for the band.

And again as with Carousel because of a difference between mono and stereo grooves, it was necessary to cut a very brief section of the music on the stereo release. In 1956, less than a year after the first mono Capitol soundtrack LP was released - Goddard Lieberson of rival Columbia Records produced a studio cast LP of Oklahoma! featuring Nelson Eddy and a supporting cast, with the chorus and orchestra directed by Lehman Engel, and using the original orchestrations.

In its first week following release the album sold over 220,000 copies, emulating Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not in going straight to number one in the UK Albums Chart, albeit selling 100,000 copies fewer than their record-breaking debut. Favourite Worst Nightmare's first day sales of 85,000 outsold the rest of the Top 20 combined, while all twelve tracks from the album entered the top 200 of the UK Singles Chart in their own right. In the USA, the album debuted at number seven, selling around 44,000 copies in its first week. The album has since gone 2x platinum in the UK and the album was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize. At the 2008 BRIT Awards it won Best British Album.\r\nIn comparison to the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, the album has been described as \"very, very fast and very,</p>",

Sheen's Life of Christ, which compares and calibrates all four Gospels. However, greater emphasis is placed on the interpersonal relationships of the major characters, in particular, Jesus, Judas and Mary Magdalene, relationships that are not described in depth in the Gospels.\nThe album reached #1 on the Billboard chart in 1971 and served as a launching pad for numerous stage productions on Broadway and in the West End. The original 1970 boxed-set issue of this 2-record set was packaged in the U.S. with a special thin brown cardboard outer box which contained the 2 vinyl records and a 28-page libretto.

In addition to Cliff, these artists include The Melodians, The Slickers, DJ Scotty, and seminal early reggae stars Desmond Dekker and Toots and the Maytals.\r\nThe soundtrack album played a major part in popularizing reggae in the United States and the world beyond, the film itself preventing the genre from remaining an isolated phenomenon in Jamaica.

Elsewhere there were current cold war themes&#8212;highly topical at the time&#8212;and further songs of isolation and regret.\r\nThe Visitors album was one of the first records to be recorded and mixed digitally, and was the first in history to be manufactured on the new CD format in 1982 on Atlantic. The Visitors has been reissued in digitally remastered form three times&#8212;first in 1997, then in 2001 and again in 2005 as part of The Complete Studio Recordings box set.\r\nOn 24 January 2012, it was announced The Visitors Deluxe Edition would be released on 23 April</p>",

But as the four members felt the energy run out of the group, they shelved these plans and instead decided to put out a double album collection of their singles from 1973 to 1982.\nIt contained most of the band's hits singles from their ten years together as recording artists, and included two new tracks: \"The Day Before You Came\" and \"Under Attack\". The Singles: The First Ten Years was released on CD By Atlantic Records in 1983, but was deleted in the late 1980s, being superseded by the more successful Abba Gold in 1992, although the album was replaced by The Definitive Collection.

He admired vocalist Layne Staley's lyrics and voice, and lead guitarist Jerry Cantrell's guitar riffs.

With the club scene under his belt, and with a small underground following, James went on to release SAW 85-92, which was mostly recorded before he started DJing and consisted of instrumental songs that were mostly beat-oriented.\r\nA remastered SAW 85&#8211;92 Compact Disc was released by Apollo/R&amp;S Records on 8 April 2008.

While mainstream America often considered these records to be ephemeral, he took them seriously and accumulated a collection of several thousand recordings, and over time began to develop an interest in seeing them preserved and curated.\r\nIn 1947, he met with Moses Asch, with an interest in selling or licensing the collection to Asch's label, Folkways Records.

In 2003, the television network VH1 named The B-52's the 99th greatest album of all time. Shortly before his death, John Lennon said he enjoyed the album. In his 1995 book, The Alternative Music Almanac, Alan Cross placed the album ninth on the list of 10 Classic Alternative Albums. In 2003, the album was ranked number 152 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\r\nCritical reception for The B-52's was generally favorable; critics praised the album's kitschy lyrics and party atmosphere.\r\nAll songs written and composed by The B-52's, except where noted.&#160;\r\nAlbum\r\nSingles</p>",

An interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg Variations (BWV 988), the work launched Gould's career as a renowned international pianist, and became one of the most well-known piano recordings. Sales were \"astonishing\" for a classical album: it was reported to have sold 40,000 copies by 1960, and had sold more than 100,000 by the time of Gould's death in 1982. By year 2000, the sale of his 1981 recording of The Goldberg Variations exceeded two million copies.\r\nAt the time of the album's release, Bach's Goldberg Variations—a set of 30 contrapuntal variations beginning and ending with an aria—was outside the standard piano repertoire, having been recorded on the instrument only a few times before, either on small labels or unreleased. The work was considered esoteric and technically demanding, requiring awkward hand crossing in various places when played on a piano. Gould's album both established the Goldberg Variations within the contemporary classical repertoire and made him an internationally famous pianist nearly \"overnight\". First played in concert by Gould in 1954, the composition was a staple of Gould's performances in the years following the recording.\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_Variations_(Glenn_Gould_recording)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read more on Wikipedia</a>",

Much more of a rock album than its predecessors, it was a departure from their previous two efforts in that its tone was darker and featured less of the harmony vocal blend that had been a centerpiece of those two albums. It also included the last two recordings by The Band of new songs credited to pianist Richard Manuel; both were co-written with guitarist Robbie Robertson, who would continue to be the group's dominant lyricist until the group disbanded in 1976. Nonetheless, the tradition of switching instruments that had begun on the previous album continued here, with each musician contributing instrumental parts on at least two different instruments. The booklet alludes to the fact that Levon Helm was high on heroin while recording \"Strawberry Wine\".\r\nEngineered by an up-and-coming Todd Rundgren, and produced by the group themselves for the first time, the album was recorded in their homebase of Woodstock, New York. The album featured an insert which became popular as a fold-out poster. The insert image was shot by photographer Norman Seeff.\r\nTwo different mixes of the album were</p>",

It was played extensively on Radio Caroline, particularly the tracks \"For No One\" (whose lyrics contain the title of the album) and \"Child of the Universe\".

Rieley also insisted that the band officially appoint Carl Wilson \"musical director\" in recognition of the integral role he had played keeping the group together since 1967. Most importantly, he demanded the completion of \"Surf's Up\" for release by composer and erstwhile bandleader Brian Wilson, a song that had taken on mythical proportions in the underground press since the demise of Smile three years earlier.

Produced by George Martin, Rubber Soul had been recorded in just over four weeks to make the Christmas market. Unlike the five albums that preceded it, Rubber Soul was recorded during a specific period, the sessions not dashed off in between either tour dates or during filming projects. After this, every Beatles album would be made without the need to pay attention to other commitments, except for the production of short promotional films or principal photography and editing to Magical Mystery Tour. The album was described as a major artistic achievement, attaining widespread critical and commercial success, with reviewers taking note of The Beatles' developing musical vision.\r\nThe original United Kingdom release shows the \"soul\" influence of the album's title. Track list changes to the United States release, including two acoustic songs held over from the previous UK album, Help!, gave the US version a folk-rock feel which critics likened to Bob Dylan and The Byrds.\r\nRubber Soul was successful commercially and critically, and is often cited as one of the greatest albums in music</p>",

Sea Change, which itself is an idiom for broad transformation, peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200, later being certified gold in March 2005 by the Recording Industry Association of America.\r\nThe album received overwhelmingly positive critical acclaim upon release, with several reviews regarding it as Beck's magnum opus. Reviewers parsed the change in style from the sonically experimental to simple and emotional.\r\nUpon completion of touring for his previous effort, Midnite Vultures (1999), Beck and his</p>",

The album&#8217;s title puns on the name of the Rock-Ola jukebox company.\r\nAfter the release of their previous album, by the end of 1968 drummer Micky Waller had been replaced by Tony Newman, Jeff Beck wishing to take the music in a heavier direction as he viewed Waller more of a finesse drummer in the style of Motown. Pianist Nicky Hopkins, who had also played on Truth, was asked to join the band full-time for their work in the studio.\r\nRecording sessions for the album took place over six days in April 1969 - the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th and 19th. Two covers of Elvis Presley tunes were chosen, \"All Shook Up\" and \"Jailhouse Rock,\" as well as an instrumental by and prominently featuring Hopkins.

Main Course also featured the first prominent use of Barry Gibb's falsetto.

On 16 February 1982 in Melbourne, Tracy Pew was arrested for drunk driving. For this and several other outstanding offences he served 2.5 months in Pentridge Prison in Australia, and so Barry Adamson was drafted in on bass duties for several tracks.

Post went on to be certified Platinum in various regions including the UK, USA, Canada, Europe and Australia, and produced three UK Top 10 singles.\r\nBj&#246;rk named the album Post for two reasons.

Second, she saw the album as posting her feelings (\"for me, all the songs on the album are like saying, 'listen, this is how I'm going'\").

Unlike Reyes, who had never sung in a studio before and Cadena, who had not even sung at all before joining the band, Rollins already had one recording credit to his name with the short-lived DC hardcore punk band State of Alert,</p>",

The album was a critical and commercial success.\r\nThe album art features a famous photograph of infamous international terrorist Carlos the Jackal colored in pop art style. This album art was inspiration for Issue 2 of the Image Comics series, Phonogram.\r\nSome say the album title is a reply to the inquiry \"Jesus, it must be great to be straight\" from the Pulp song 'Do you remember the first time?'.\r\nThe opening lines of 'In the Name of the Father' are quoted in the novel The Demented Lands by Alan Warner.\r\nThe song \"A Big Day In the North\" was used as the opening song in the 1995 scifi movie \"Virtuosity\" with Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe.\r\nThe song \"Yeah Yeah Brother\" featured in the film \"The Devil</p>",

This was because there was another band also known as Earth, and also as homage to the 1963 classic Mario Bava terror film starring Boris Karloff. Around the same time they recorded and distributed a demo version of their eponymous song. In November 1969 they recorded their debut single, \"Evil Woman\", released in January 1970, and recorded and mixed the remaining seven songs that would appear on their debut album.

The album was recorded at Regent Sound Studios and Island Studios in London, England. The album's eponymous single \"Paranoid\" was written in the studio at the last minute to fulfill the record label's request for a single.\r\nAs drummer Bill Ward explains: \"We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the \"Paranoid\" guitar lick and that was it.

With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a \"giant synthesizer\". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but due in part to substance abuse and fatigue, were unable to complete any songs. \"Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent\" Iommi said. \"Everybody was sitting</p>",

We took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album - Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath wasn't a rock album, really.\"\r\nThe album is a mix of heavy, powerful songs such as \"Hole in the Sky\" and \"Symptom of the Universe\", and softer experimental songs such as \"Supertzar\" and \"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\", which are similar to the band's previous album. The title of the latter caused some confusion due to the \"(Radio)\" part, which led people to believe the song was a radio cut or radio version. However, this is the only version of the song.

Geoff Nicholls of Quartz also joined the band as a possible replacement for Geezer Butler who had not been around through most of the writing sessions and was going through a divorce at the time. When Butler decided to stay with the group, Nicholls switched to keyboards. Nicholls remained as Black Sabbath's keyboard player for over twenty years, usually playing live shows from off-stage.\r\nFormer Elf and Rainbow bassist Craig Gruber also rehearsed with the band.

It spawned several hit singles in the UK, most notably \"Beetlebum\" and \"Song 2\". Blur was also a hit in the US, with \"Song 2\" becoming a hit and the album being certified gold.\r\nThe album's style was resultant of Blur's dropping their previous Britpop mantle in favor of lo-fi and alternative rock recordings, reportedly at Graham Coxon's urging. As a result, Blur was a hit primarily because it proved that Blur could evolve beyond their Britpop roots. The album's move from Britpop was emphasised by this being the first Blur album not to use Stylorouge cover-art and also not to have lyrics and chords printed in the liner notes, instead having a composite photo of the band in the studio spread out over three panels. The album featured the first song in which Graham Coxon not only wrote the lyrics, but also provided lead vocals, for the song \"You're So Great\". He would later do the same for \"Coffee &amp; TV\" for Blur's next album.\r\nAll songs written and composed by Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon, Alex James and Dave Rowntree, except</p>",

During their time off, Jon Bon Jovi wrote the soundtrack for Young Guns II, which was released in 1990 as the Blaze of Glory album and Richie Sambora released his first solo album called Stranger in This Town. By this time, Jon Bon Jovi fired his long time manager, Doc McGhee and created Bon Jovi Management. Jon decided to take on a larger role, and more responsibilities within the band. The band quickly became a corporation with Jon at the helm.\r\nIn October 1991 the band went to a Caribbean island of St. Thomas to discuss plans for the future; the band's internal problems were solved and they were ready to have a go at a comeback. According to an interview with Jon Bon Jovi on Keep the Faith: The Videos, the album's original title was to be \"Revenge\". In January 1992 the band headed to Little Mountain Studios in Vancouver.

As Bowie was preoccupied with his new wife Angie at the time, the music was largely arranged by guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist/producer Tony Visconti.

The title track of the album became one of Bowie's biggest hit singles, reaching number 1 in the UK, the US and various other countries. Further singles included \"Modern Love\" and \"China Girl\", which both reached number 2 in the UK. \"China Girl\" was actually a new version of a song which Bowie had co-written with Iggy Pop for the latter's 1977 album The Idiot. The album also contains a rerecorded version of the song \"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" which had been a minor hit for Bowie a year earlier. Let's Dance is also notable as a stepping stone for the career of the late Texas blues guitar virtuoso Stevie Ray Vaughan, who played on the album. The album was also released as a limited edition picture disc in 1983. Let's Dance has sold 6 million copies worldwide, making it Bowie's best-selling album.\r\nBowie, having just signed with EMI records for a reported $17.5m (in 1983 currency), worked with Nile Rodgers to release a \"commercially buoyant\" new album that was described as \"original party-funk cum big bass drum sound greater than the sum of its influences.\" The album's influences</p>",

Brown's record label, King Records, originally opposed releasing the album, believing that a live album featuring no new songs would not be profitable. The label finally relented under pressure from Brown and his manager Bud Hobgood. (It was disagreements such as this that moved Brown to begin recording for Smash Records the following year, in violation of his contract with King).\r\nTo King's surprise, Live at the Apollo was an amazingly rapid seller. It spent 66 weeks on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, peaking at #2.

It peaked at #14 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart. It is considered by many fans, critics and musicians to be his best and most influential album.\r\nBrowne has publicly acknowledged that the acclaimed cover art for Late for the Sky was inspired by the 1954 painting \"L'Empire des Lumieres\" (\"Empire of Light\"), by Belgian surrealist Ren&#233; Magritte. The album itself contains the credit, \"cover concept Jackson Browne if it's all reet with Magritte.\" The original photograph was shot on a South Pasadena residential street, several miles from Browne's childhood Highland Park, California home. Designer and front cover photographer Bob Seldemann said, \"I spoke to Jackson in 1980 and he told me he thought it was his favorite cover. Lest the jacket appear too funereal, a mood-defusing photo of a relaxed Jackson, almost smiling and looking as though he has a surprise to share, occupies a small square of the back cover.\"\r\nThe title track was featured prominently in the 1976 Martin Scorsese film Taxi Driver.\r\nIn his speech inducting Browne</p>",

It marked the beginning of Buckley's experimental period, as it incorporated elements of jazz that he had never used before. Many of the songs here represent a departure from the binary form that dominated much of his previous work. The sound of the album is characterized by David Friedman's vibraphone, an instrument which gives the album a more relaxed tone than Buckley's earlier work. The songs are much longer than on previous releases and this style continued through to later works. The vocals on the album are more drawn out than earlier performances and this represents the beginning of Buckley using his voice like an instrument. The lyrics on Happy Sad represent a change as Buckley stopped working with Larry Beckett, his lyricist on the two previous albums Tim Buckley and Goodbye and Hello, and began writing the lyrics himself. Buckley's self-penned efforts stand in contrast to Beckett's occasionally political and literary-style work.

In an attempt to compensate for Clark's absence, guitarists Jim McGuinn and David Crosby stepped into the breach and increased their songwriting output. In spite of this, the loss of Clark resulted in an uneven album that included a total of four cover versions and an instrumental. However, the album is notable for being the first by The Byrds not to include any songs written by Bob Dylan, whose material had previously been a mainstay of the band's repertoire.\r\nThe album peaked at #24 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and reached #27 on the UK Albums Chart. Two preceding singles, \"Eight Miles High\" and \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\", were included on the album, with the former just missing the Top 10 of the Billboard singles chart.

Two of Hillman's compositions on Younger Than Yesterday exhibited country and western influences and thus, can be seen as early indicators of the country rock direction the band would pursue on their later albums.

Combining elements of blues, avant-garde, free jazz and other genres of American music, the album is regarded as an important work of experimental music and a major influence on genres such as alternative rock and post-punk.\r\nMost of Trout Mask Replica was recorded in March 1969 at Whitney Studios in Los Angeles, California. The lineup of The Magic Band at this time consisted of Bill Harkleroad and Jeff Cotton on guitar, Mark Boston on bass guitar, Victor Hayden on bass clarinet, and John French on drums and percussion. Beefheart played several brass and woodwind instruments (including saxophone, musette, and hunting horn) and contributed most of the vocal parts, with Zappa and various members of the band providing occasional vocals and narration.

Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote and produced most of her two previous albums. With Daydream, Carey took more control over the musical direction as well as the album's composition. Carey said she considered Daydream the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation, a change that became more obvious in her 1997 release, Butterfly. During the album's production, Carey endured many creative differences with her label, Columbia Records and husband, Tommy Mottola.\r\nOn Daydream, Carey collaborated with Jermaine Dupri for the first time, and co-wrote and produced a song with Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, with whom she had collaborated on Music Box.

It was preceded by the release of \"The Ship Song/The Train Song\" single. \"The Weeping Song/Cock's 'n' Asses\" was later also released as a single. After an album as dark and intense as Tender Prey, some fans were disappointed to hear a relaxed and loving Nick Cave on this record. The change of mood was due in great deal to Nick Cave falling in love with Brazilian journalist Viviane Carneiro, and an apparently salutary spell in rehab which purged the despair and squalor of the previous two albums. However, today, most fans consider this album as a classic that was unfairly judged at the time. Indeed, \"The Weeping Song\" and \"The Ship Song\" are now Bad Seeds standards, and the relatively obscure closing track \"Lucy\" was resurrected in 1993 as a B-side of \"What a Wonderful World\", a collaboration of the Bad Seeds and the Pogues' Shane MacGowan.\r\nThe album was remastered and reissued on March 29, 2010 as a collector's edition CD/DVD set.\r\nAll songs written by Cave unless otherwise stated.\r\n\"Foi Na Cruz\" is based partly upon the traditional Brazilian Protestant hymn of the same title.

Though the bulk of The Boatman's Call was recorded at Sarm West, further recordings &#8212; including overdubs &#8212; were later done at Abbey Road Studios.\r\nMusically, the album's tone is considered sombre and minimalist and marks a major departure for Cave and The Bad Seeds. Moving away from full-band arrangements and character-based narratives, the album's music and lyrics move towards the more intimate sound of Cave's solo voice accompanied by piano or a few other instruments. The tempo is also generally slow, reflecting many of the moods of the songs. Many of the lyrics seem to reflect on Cave's personal relationships and spiritual yearnings at the time of writing.

Cave had to overcome heavy heroin and alcohol addictions in 1999-2000 before starting work on the album. It was met with mostly positive reviews, often called \"beautiful\" with its heavy use of piano, though some Nick Cave critics or fans who preferred his earlier music disliked it (see the Nude as the News review). At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received a generally favourable score of 79, based on 18 reviews.\r\nThe album showcases the virtuoso talents of the Bad Seeds, with elaborate instrumental sections on nearly every track. Also, Cave's lyrics are less obscure than usual, and he sings in a wider vocal range than he had previously, reaching Alto on several tracks.\r\nAll songs written and composed by Nick Cave, except where noted.&#160;\r\nA limited-edition version included a bonus disc with two extra tracks, plus multi-media CD-ROM files (the 2 bonus tracks also</p>",

They are also influenced by Neneh's motherhood. Others speak of women allegedly trying to steal a man from another woman. All players and programmers are credited in this album, however Cameron McVey, Cherry's husband, appears as Booga Bear. Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja co-wrote \"Manchild\", and fellow member Andrew Vowles aka DJ Mushroom performs on \"Kisses on the Wind\", \"The Next Generation\" and \"So Here I Come\". \"My Bitch\" is a vocal duet with Gilly G.\r\nThe cover and inner photos were shot by fashion</p>",

While The Chicago Transit Authority was a success, Chicago is considered by many to be Chicago&#39;s breakthrough album, yielding a number of Top 40 hits, including &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; (#9), &quot;Colour My World&quot; (#7), and &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; (#4). The centerpiece of the album was the thirteen-minute song cycle &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot;. Guitarist Terry Kath also participated in an extended classically styled cycle of four pieces, three of which were co-written by the well-known, arranger, composer, and pianist Peter Matz. The politically outspoken Robert Lamm also tackles his qualms with &quot;It Better End Soon&quot;, another modular piece.

Chicago V is also notable for Robert Lamm's prolific songwriting; eight out of its ten tunes are composed solely by him.\r\nRecorded just before Chicago at Carnegie Hall was released in the fall of 1971, Chicago V was cut in just over a week and held over for release until the following summer.

Anticipating the \"world music\" trend of the 1980s, it features reggae, jazz, mock gospel, rockabilly, folk, dub, rhythm and blues, calypso, and rap. For the first time, the band's traditional songwriting credits of Strummer and Jones were replaced by a generic credit to the Clash, and the band cut the album royalties, in order to release the 3-LP at a low price.\r\nThe title comes from the Nicaraguan socialist political party, the Sandinistas, and its catalogue number, 'FSLN1', refers to the acronym for Frente Sandinista de Liberaci&#243;n Nacional. Sandinista! was voted the best album of the year in The Village Voice's Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, and it was ranked number 404 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. Slant Magazine listed the album at #85 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980's\" in 2012.\r\nThe album was recorded over most of 1980, in London, Manchester, Jamaica and New York. It was produced by the band (which essentially meant Mick Jones and Joe Strummer),</p>",

Its title established the name of the then-nascent free jazz movement. The album features a double quartet, one in each stereo channel; the rhythm sections play simultaneously, and though there is a succession of solos as is usual in jazz, they are peppered with freeform commentaries by the other horns that often turn into full-scale collective improvisation. The pre-composed material is a series of brief, dissonant fanfares for the horns which serve as interludes between solos. Not least among the album's achievements was that it was the first LP-length improvisation, nearly forty minutes in length, which was unheard of at the time.\r\nThe album was identified by Chris Kelsey in his Allmusic essay \"Free Jazz: A Subjective History\" as one of the 20 Essential Free Jazz Albums. It served as the blueprint for later large-ensemble free jazz recordings such as John Coltrane's Ascension and Peter Br&#246;tzmann's Machine Gun.\r\nThe original LP package incorporated Jackson Pollock's 1954 painting The White Light.

However, Thiele encouraged Hartman to go see Coltrane perform at Birdland in New York to see if something could be worked out. Hartman did so, and after the club closed he, Coltrane, and Coltrane's pianist McCoy Tyner, went over some songs together.

Much credit is generally given to producer Bob Ezrin, cleaning up the band's sound with fresh ideas and making it more accessible, most notably on the track, 'I'm Eighteen'. It originally was a much longer song, and in more of a psychedelic vein like the band's first two albums, which contained several longer songs.\r\nThe album cover caused much controversy at the time of its release. Early pressings show Cooper's thumb sticking out of his pants, thus giving the illusion of a penis (see cover photo).

It is the only Cure album to feature keyboardist Matthieu Hartley, and was featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album reached number 20 on the British album charts. \r\nThe record, mostly a collection of downbeat tracks, features ambient echoing vocals and minimally-treated instruments, with the album's sonic direction driven by its drum sound. Due to budgetary restraints, the record was recorded and mixed in seven days on a budget of between &#163;2000 and &#163;3000, which resulted in the band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album. Smith stated that as a result, the track \"The Final Sound\" was actually planned to be much longer, but was cut down to 53 seconds because the tape ran out while recording, and they couldn't record it again. Inspiration was also very high, as Smith wrote the lyrics and music for most of the record on just two occasions. Most of the music was composed by Smith in his parents' home, on a Hammond organ with a built in tape recorder. Interviewed in 2004, producer Mike Hedges does not recall any demo tracks, with the band</p>",

Just months after the bleak Pornography, the band released the single \"Let's Go to Bed\" which just featured Smith, Lol Tolhurst and session drummer Steve Goulding. Following this was \"The Walk\", and then \"The Lovecats\". These three singles and their b-sides were compiled and became Japanese Whispers (1983). The Top is the first conventional studio album to follow this new side of The Cure. It marks a change from the upbeat synthpop of Japanese Whispers to a psychedelic, experimental sound.\r\nDue to the conflicts and band lineup troubles, Smith wrote almost all of the music himself, and played almost all the instruments (except the drums).

The record marks a return to the introspective and gloomy gothic rock style the band had established in the early 1980s. As he neared the age of thirty, vocalist and guitarist Robert Smith had felt an increased pressure to follow up on the group's pop successes with a more enduring work. This, coupled with a distaste for the group's new-found popularity, caused Smith to lapse back into the use of hallucinogenic drugs, the effects of which had a strong influence on the production of the album. The Cure recorded Disintegration at Hookend Recording Studios in Checkendon, Oxfordshire, with co-producer David M. Allen from late 1988 to early 1989. During production, founding member Lol Tolhurst was fired from the band.\r\nIn spite of Fiction's fears that the album would be \"commercial suicide\", Disintegration became the band's commercial peak. It charted at number three in the United Kingdom and at number twelve in the United States, and produced several hit singles including \"Lovesong\", which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.

It compiles twelve songs recorded by Davis's nonet for the label over the course of three sessions during 1949 and 1950.\r\nFeaturing unusual instrumentation and several notable musicians, the music consisted of innovative arrangements influenced by classical music techniques such as polyphony, and marked a major development in post-bebop jazz. As the title implies, these recordings are considered seminal in the history of cool jazz. The majority of the recordings were originally released in the ten inch 78 rpm format and are all approximately three minutes long.\r\nIn 1947 Miles Davis was playing in Charlie Parker's quintet. Parker had called on Davis's trumpet after splitting with Dizzy Gillespie in 1945 due to the formers growing alcohol and drug problem. Davis recorded several albums with Parker at this time, including Parker's Sessions for the Savoy and Dial labels. By 1948 Davis had three years of bebop playing under his belt, but he struggled to match the speed and ranges of the likes of Gillespie and Parker, choosing instead to play in the mid range of his</p>",

It is the band's best-selling album to date, selling over 20 million copies worldwide, and spawning six hit singles. The album charted at #1 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the UK Albums Chart.\r\nHysteria was produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. The title of the album was thought up by drummer Rick Allen, relating to his experiences during the time of his auto accident, and the worldwide media coverage that followed. It's also the last album to feature guitarist Steve Clark, but their next album, Adrenalize is the last to feature his songwriting.\r\nThe album was the follow-up to the band's 1983 breakthrough Pyromania. Its creation process took over three years having been plagued by many trials, such as the 31 December 1984 car accident that cost Rick Allen his left arm. Subsequent to the release of the album, Def Leppard published a book entitled Animal Instinct: The Def Leppard Story, written by Rolling Stone magazine Senior Editor David Fricke on the recording process of Hysteria over the 3+ years it took to record the album and the tough times the band</p>",

However, Steve Clark's alcoholism was taking a turn for the worse. Whereas touring had kept him sober onstage, offstage his condition was beginning to affect his work in the studio. In addition, Mutt Lange was unavailable to return as producer as he was working with Canadian rocker Bryan Adams on Waking Up the Neighbours.\r\nThe band chose to produce the album themselves. Steve's problems did not help to advance progress and in fact, was starting to set them back. In late 1989, Clark was found unconscious in a gutter in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Both Iggy and Bowie, as well as Brian Eno and Robert Fripp, expressed interest in producing Devo first release.

In an attempt to reach a wider audience, the album combined many elements: ornate orchestral frills and African chanting, and instruments like the violin, Spanish guitar, trombone, the cavaquinho, and saxophone created a new sound. The singles encompassed a variety of musical styles: the title track and River Deep, Mountain High (a Tina Turner cover) made prominent use of percussion instruments; It's All Coming Back To Me Now (a remake of Jim Steinman's song) and a remake of Eric Carmen's All By Myself kept their soft-rock atmosphere, but were combined with the classical sound of the piano; and the maudlin ballad, Because You Loved Me, written by Diane Warren, served as the theme to the 1996 film Up Close &amp; Personal. The song was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1996, as well as 4 Grammy Awards.

Its layered sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative rock bands popular at the time and laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work. OK Computer was the first self-produced Radiohead album, with assistance from Nigel Godrich. Radiohead recorded the album in Oxfordshire and Bath between 1996 and early 1997, with most of the recording completed in the historic mansion St. Catherine's Court. On delivery to Capitol, the label lowered its sales estimates due to the album's unconventional, unmarketable sound. Nevertheless, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and became Radiohead's highest album entry on the American charts at the time, debuting at number 21 on the Billboard 200.

They continued until January 1966, but yielded only one track that made it onto the final album&#8212;\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\". At Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, accompanied by keyboard player Al Kooper and guitarist Robbie Robertson, moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.\r\nThe album completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, commencing with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited.

It is the only Hendrix studio album professionally produced under his supervision. It topped the Billboard 200 album chart for two weeks in November 1968. The original North American-only Reprise release album cover featured a \"fiery\" photo of Hendrix' head. The slightly later Track/Polydor International album release cover, controversially, was a photo of a group of nude women, which was only replaced after Experience Hendrix took control of Hendrix' recordings. In most Francophone parts of Europe, Barclay Records used a cover showing a downward pointing arm at a very small photo of Hendrix' head.\r\nReleased as a double album, Electric Ladyland is a cross-section of Hendrix's wide range of musical talent. It includes examples of several genres and styles of music: the psychedelic \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\", previously a U.K. single in the summer of 1967; the extended blues jam \"Voodoo Chile\"; the New Orleans-style R&amp;B of Earl King's \"Come On\"; the epic studio production of \"1983...

James Taylor, who encouraged King to sing her own songs, and who also played on Tapestry, would have a #1 hit with \"You've Got a Friend.\" Two songs were co-written with Toni Stern: \"It's Too Late\" and \"Where You Lead\".\r\nTapestry was number 1 on the Billboard 200 for 15 consecutive weeks, and held the record</p>",

Whereas his debut album Bob Dylan had contained only two original songs, Freewheelin' initiated the process of writing contemporary words to traditional melodies. Eleven of the thirteen songs on the album are original compositions by Dylan. The album kicks off with \"Blowin' in the Wind\", which would become one of the anthems of the 1960s, and an international hit for folk trio Peter, Paul &amp; Mary soon after the release of Freewheelin'. The album featured several other songs which came to be regarded as amongst Dylan's best compositions and classics of the 1960s folk scene: \"Girl from the North Country\", \"Masters of War\", \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" and \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\".\r\nDylan's lyrics embraced stories ripped from the headlines about civil rights and he articulated anxieties about the fear of nuclear warfare. Balancing this political material were love songs, sometimes bitter and accusatory, and material that features surreal humor. Freewheelin' showcased Dylan's songwriting talent for the first time, propelling him to national</p>",

With a slick, sophisticated sound thanks to producer Peter Walsh, Simple Minds was soon categorized as part of the \"New Romantic\" outgrowth of New Wave (along with Duran Duran and others), and the record generated a handful of charting singles including \"Promised You a Miracle\" and \"Glittering Prize\", both of which became concert favorites over the years. In addition, the jazz keyboardist Herbie Hancock performed a synth solo on the track \"Hunter and the Hunted.\" Despite the success of the album, these commercial moves were loudly criticized by fans of Simple Minds' early work, so the next record,Sparkle in the Rain, gave them even more to complain about. \r\n\r\nVirgin reissued the album on a remastered CD in 2002 (cardboard vinyl replica edition) and early 2003 (jewel-case). On the 2002/2003 edition, the gaps between the tracks on the album are slightly shorter.The remastered edition is noticeably louder and has the low-end and the high-end more prominent. \r\n\r\nVirgin reissued the album</p>",

The album goes in a different direction from Ian Anderson's earlier work, revealing influences from Celtic, folk, and classical music. In particular, the song \"Fat Man\" showed an interest in unusual instrumentation, as Ian Anderson played mandolin, one of the first times the instrument had been used by a rock band.

It was also one of the earliest double albums in rock music (although Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde preceded it by a week), and the first 2-record debut. In the UK the album was originally released as a single disc.\r\nThe album was produced by Tom Wilson, who signed The Mothers, formerly a bar band called the Soul Giants. Zappa said many years later that Wilson signed the group to a record deal in the belief that they were a white blues band. The album features vocalist Ray Collins, along with bass player Roy Estrada, drummer Jimmy Carl Black and guitar player Elliot Ingber, who would later join Captain Beefheart's Magic Band under the name Winged Eel Fingerling.\r\nThe band's original repertoire consisted of rhythm and blues covers; though after Zappa joined the band he encouraged them to play his own original material, and the name was changed to The Mothers.

The title was quickly changed back to Mr. Fantasy but the new cover remained until Island Records reissued the UK version in the late 1970s. Both the US and UK editions were released in substantially different stereo and mono mixes. One song in particular, \"Giving to You\", was released in 3 different versions, including similar mono and stereo versions from the U.K. album, plus a very different mono U.K. b-side mix, which also was later included on the U.S. mono LP. The special U.K. b-side mix includes lyrics sung by Winwood</p>",

On side one of the original LP, Dylan is backed by an electric rock and roll band - a move that further alienated him from some of his former peers in the folk song community. Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\"), as his lyrics continued their trend towards the abstract and personal.\r\nThe album reached #6 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, the first of Dylan's LPs to break into the US top 10. It also topped the UK charts later that Spring. The lead-off track, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", became Dylan's first single to chart in the US, peaking at #39.\r\nDylan spent much of the summer of 1964 in Woodstock, a small town in upstate New York. Dylan was already familiar with the area, but his visits were becoming longer and more frequent. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, also had a place in Woodstock, and when Joan Baez went to see Dylan that</p>",

And on this album some of those characters include low-lifes, losers, racists, and drunks. These picaresques were often used by Newman to satirize conventional song lyrics. For instance, on this album he deconstructed the conventions of the love song on tracks like \"Have You Seen My Baby?,\" \"Suzanne,\" and \"Lucinda.\"\r\nSome of the targets of Newman's satire on this album (which he would return to on future albums) include racism (\"Yellow Man\"), L.A.'s rock scene (\"Mama Told Me Not to Come\"), and the South (\"Old Kentucky Home\").

It was released in February 1976.\r\nAfter Peter Gabriel left Genesis, the remaining members held auditions for a permanent lead singer, although some members (most notably Banks) considered continuing as an instrumental act, as most songs were written without knowledge as to how they would be sung. Initially, Phil Collins did not wish to take over for Gabriel, opting instead to teach the potential lead singers the songs. One of the 400 auditioners, Mick Stickland, came close to being chosen, but the band and Mick decided in the end against working together. According to the band members, the backing tracks for A Trick of the Tail had already been recorded and were in a key in which Mick was not comfortable singing. When the auditions failed to produce a suitable vocalist, Collins reluctantly went in the studio to sing \"Squonk\" and the band decided that Collins should be the new vocalist.\r\nThe album was recorded at Relight Studios and mixed at Trident Studios in October/November</p>",

Several of the story's occurrences and places were derived from Peter Gabriel's dreams, and the protagonist's name is a play on his surname. In the 1991 documentary \"Genesis: A History\", Phil Collins remarked, \"It's about a 'split personality' (referring to the live performance of \"it.\"). In this context, Rael would believe he is looking for John but is actually looking for a missing part of himself. The individual songs also make satirical allusions to mythology, the sexual revolution, advertising, and consumerism. The title track, \"The Carpet Crawlers\", and \"In the Cage\" are live favourites for the band.

In a 1975 BBC Radio 1 interview, Roy Halee identified this version of \"The 59th Street Bridge Song\" as being from Simon &amp; Garfunkel's 1970 performance at Carnegie Hall, \"the last concert they did together\" (prior to their disbanding later in 1970).

It was certified Gold on 5/21/1975 and was certified Platinum and 3x Platinum on 3/23/1993 by the RIAA. In Canada, it also debuted at number 1 on the RPM national Top Albums chart and only broke a run of what would have been fifteen consecutive weeks at the top by falling one position to number 2 in the ninth week (May 31 - September 6). On the UK Albums Chart, it peaked at number 2. In 2003, the album was ranked number 158 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. This was the last album until Too Low For Zero that Elton John and his classic band would play together.\r\nWritten, according to lyricist Bernie Taupin, in chronological order, Captain Fantastic is a concept album that gives an autobiographical glimpse at the struggles John (Captain Fantastic) and Taupin (the Brown Dirt Cowboy) had in the early years of their musical careers in London (from 1967 to 1969).

The record was a key factor and major influence on the New York punk rock scene.\r\nAt the time she recorded Horses, Patti Smith and her band were favorites in the New York club scene along with Blondie and The Ramones. The former's influence can be best heard in the track \"Gloria\", a radical retake on the Them song. \"Birdland\", in particular, owed more to the jazz which Smith's mother enjoyed than to the influence of punk. When recording this song, which was improvised by the band in Electric Lady Studios, Smith has said she imagined the spirit of Jimi Hendrix watching her. The lyrics of \"Birdland\" are based upon A Book of Dreams, a 1973 memoir of Wilhelm Reich by his son Peter. Several of the album's songs &#8212; \"Redondo Beach\", \"Free Money\", \"Kimberly\" &#8212; were inspired by moments with members of Smith's family, while others &#8212; \"Break It Up\", \"Elegie\" &#8212; were written about her idols. \"Land\" was already a live favorite and featured the first verse of Chris Kenner's \"Land of a Thousand Dances\" and contains a tribute to her long-time idol Arthur Rimbaud.\" Guest musicians</p>",

The September 1988 CD re-release was issued as two separate single CD volumes, with one extra track per disc. Since many of the band's studio albums were out of print in the USA from the early 1970s through the mid-1980s, 1969 was one of the more popular albums by the band, and is a fan favorite. Spin Magazine's Alternative Record Guide included it in the top 100 alternative albums of all time in 1995.\nDuring 1969, The Velvet Underground toured the United States and Canada, playing well over 70 dates. By this time, the band had picked up a sizeable fan base and every now and then a fan would bring along, with consent of the band, recording equipment to record a set.\nMost of the time, this would mean relatively simple hand-held recorders resulting in lo-fi audience recordings. On two occasions, however, professional equipment was used. On October 19, 1969 in the End of Cole Ave. club, Dallas, a fan who happened to be a recording engineer brought along his professional gear; and in November at The Matrix in San Francisco, the</p>",

Also completed was the backing track for \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" and the R&amp;B throwback \"Who's Driving Your Plane?\", which would appear as a B-side to the somewhat psychedelic \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" single in late September.

It collects singles, B-sides, and album tracks originally recorded for Reaction Records and Track Records between 1966 and 1968. Original U.K. issues of this album were released in both stereo and mono versions. The album was not a strong seller and was deleted in the early 1970s. This was the fourth U.K. LP released by The Who.\nEarlier Who recordings from 1965, such as My Generation, were released in the U.K. by Brunswick Records and were not available for this release due to licensing issues. This limitation makes the collection rather unrepresentative of The Who's work up to 1968.\nDirect Hits shares a few songs with the earlier U.S. compilation album Magic Bus: The Who on Tour, but is otherwise unrelated to that release. Strangely, it does not include the song Magic Bus, which had reached #26 on the U.K. singles chart during the summer of 1968. Until the early 1980s this was the only album to include a few Who rarities such as \"In the City\", \"Dogs\", and \"The Last Time.\"\nThe album is of interest mostly to collectors.

In June 1976, for example, Seger played the Pontiac Silverdome in metropolitan Detroit at a historic concert that also included Point Blank, Elvin Bishop, and Todd Rundgren. 78,000 people were in attendance and the concert lasted until nearly 1:30 a.m. The next night, Seger played before less than a thousand people in Chicago.\r\nHowever, it was only in the following winter that the</p>",

The stamp, printed in black and placed in the middle of the cover, reads as follows: A record company is not mentioned on either the label or sleeve. This bootleg is considered rather rare, as are many coming from the early 1970s.

Desmond Child produced the 2006 album, Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster is Loose.\r\nThe album developed from a musical, Neverland, a sci-fi update of Peter Pan, which Steinman wrote for a workshop in 1974, and performed at the Kennedy Center Music Theatre Lab in 1977.

However, he admits that the chief purpose of the album was to buy time; the band was under pressure to produce a suitable follow-up to the immense success of Breakfast in America, and needed to get off the treadmill of touring and recording for a while in order to consider their direction for such an album.

When Stewart discovered that Hancock was not well-known in the United States, he went back to his original title \"Year of the Cat\".\r\nThe cover design, by Hipgnosis and illustrator Colin Elgie, depicts a woman who has an apparent obsession with cats.

Lillywhite first came to fame with his work on the 1978's debut single of Siouxsie and the Banshees, \"Hong Kong Garden\" which featured a peculiar hook played by a glockenspiel. U2, who already listened to Siouxsie and the Banshees, used Lillywhite's skills to add the distinctive glockenspiel part on \"I Will Follow\".\r\nSome of the songs, including \"An Cat Dubh\" and \"The Ocean\", were written and recorded in the studio.

Several singles from the album were successful, including \"Urgent\", \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\", and \"Juke Box Hero\". These propelled the album to being Foreigner's only #1 album in the US.\r\nThe album was originally titled Silent Partners and later was changed to 4. In 1981, renowned art studio Hipgnosis was asked to design a cover based on the original title, and they developed a black &amp; white image of a young man in bed with a pair of binoculars looming overhead. The resulting design was rejected by the band as they felt it was \"too homosexual\". The replacement cover for 4 was designed by Bob Defrin and modeled after an old fashioned film leader. Hipgnosis is still credited with designing the record labels.\r\nThe album marked the completion of the band's shift to hard rock, begun in Head Games. Both Ian McDonald and Al Greenwood had left before the recording of 4. As a result, all of the songs on the album are compositions by Mick Jones and/or Lou Gramm. McDonald and Greenwood had played saxophone and keyboards, respectively, and so several</p>",

The album finishes with the rockabilly ode to mutual masturbation, \"Jack U Off\". This record was considered to be his most political and controversial to date.

The performances were recorded in Paris in 1976 and 1977 on their tours in support of A Trick of the Tail and Wind &amp; Wuthering. At the end of several songs the crowd can be heard encouraging the band to play another song by chanting \"Une autre!\" which literally means \"another one\".\nSeconds Out is the band's second live album following 1973's Genesis Live. While the earlier live set had been released to mark time while they recorded Selling England by the Pound, Seconds Out was planned as a major release, an authoritative document of Genesis' sound with Phil Collins as frontman and lead vocalist. The recording includes former Weather Report drummer Chester Thompson at the start of his long tenure as concert drummer for the band. Former Yes and King Crimson drummer Bill Bruford, the first drummer to take over for Collins on the stage, played drums on the band's 1976 tour, from which the recording of \"The Cinema Show\" was taken. Thompson replaced Bruford on the band's 1977 tour, which was the source of all other songs on the album. Guitarist Steve</p>",

The title track became particularly popular and it remains one of Eurythmics' most recognisable songs, and its music video, popular on MTV in the United States, is memorable for Annie Lennox's gender-bending imagery. In the wake of this success, the single \"Love Is a Stranger\", previously a flop, was re-released and became a hit as well. It too was accompanied by a striking video, which featured Lennox dressed both as a man and a woman.\r\nThe album was re-released in 2005, with the rest of the Eurythmics' studio catalog, excluding the 1984 (For the Love of Big Brother) album, to which Virgin Records holds the rights. The recordings were remastered and added several bonus tracks to each of eight albums.

In later interviews, the band admitted that they started to listen to outsiders about what direction the music should go around the time of Dynasty.\r\nThe album and the following tour, were billed as the \"Return of Kiss\" as a band. Kiss (Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss) had not released a studio album since 1977's Love Gun. Instead, Kiss released their second live album and each member had recorded eponymous solo albums, which were simultaneously released on September 18, 1978. The reception was mixed, with Frehley's album being widely regarded as the best and Criss' album the worst.\r\nAfter pre-production and rehearsals were completed, Vini Poncia (who had produced Peter Criss), decided that Criss' drumming was substandard, an opinion shared by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons.

It fared better, however, in the UK Indie Chart, placing at number 2 in the first indie chart to be published in January 1980, and going on to top the chart when redistributed in July 1980, spending 136 weeks in the chart in total.\r\nThe album was critically acclaimed from the start.

The album marked the end of a three year period of forced hiatus from recording brought on by contractual obligations and legal battling with former manager Mike Appel. Although the album did not produce high charting singles it nevertheless remained on the charts for 97 weeks. In September 2010 a documentary film chronicling the making of Darkness was first shown at the Toronto International Film Festival. Quoting Springsteen as saying &#8220;More than rich, more than famous, more than happy &#8211; I wanted to be great&#8221;, reviewer Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger commented: \"For many fans, that long journey pulled onto the Turnpike here.\"\r\nRecovering from legal troubles and the stress of the breakthrough success of Born to Run, Springsteen released a somewhat less commercial album, Darkness on the Edge of Town.\r\nIn terms of the original LP's sequencing, Springsteen continued his \"four corners\" approach from Born to Run, as the songs beginning each side (\"Badlands\" and \"The Promised Land\") were martial rallying cries to overcome circumstances, while the songs ending each side</p>",

Ironically, however, some of the tracks that could be considered to be the most 'English' were actually co-written with American Steve Nugent. Jankel was later given a third writing credit for these songs (\"Billericay Dickie\", \"Plaistow Patricia\", \"My Old Man\" and \"Blackmail Man\") on the album's original press and some subsequent compilations; however, over the years this credit has been gradually 'phased</p>",

Robinson began popularizing the band by writing about them in the magazines she edited. Robinson contacted Danny Fields and asked him to manage the band, which he agreed to in November 1975.

The band's moniker is written in reverse on the front cover.\r\nAccording to the Rolling Stone Album Guide, \"1999 may be Prince's most influential album: Its synth-and-drum machine-heavy arrangements codified the Minneapolis sound that loomed over mid-'80s R&amp;B and pop, not to mention the next two decades' worth of electro, house, and techno.\" In 2003, the TV network VH1 placed 1999 49th in its list of the greatest albums of all time. The album was also part of Slant Magazine's list \"The 50 Most Essential Pop Albums\" and the magazine listed the album at #8 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980's\". The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008. In 2003, the album was ranked</p>",

Dare became critically acclaimed and has proved to be a genre-defining album, whose influence can be felt in many areas of pop music today. The album and its four singles were hugely successful commercially, with the album reaching #1 in the UK and being certified Triple Platinum by the BPI.\r\nThe track list on the original album:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following studio equipment was used in the recording of the album:\r\nIn 1981 the Human League considered themselves a \"song based group\"; this was a deliberate distinction differentiating the band from other electronic artists who specialized in principally instrumental work.

The concept was never fully developed, and it remains unclear which tracks were originally intended as part of the story, though it is commonly agreed that \"Thick As Thieves\", \"Little Boy Soldiers\", \"Wasteland\", and \"Burning Sky\" are likely constituents; extant Jam bootlegs feature a version of \"Little Boy Soldiers\" split into three separate recordings, possible evidence that the song was intended to serve as a recurring motif, with separate sections appearing between</p>",

The Mothership Connection draws on the imagery linking Black people and space travel pioneered by Sun Ra and that is important for Afrofuturism.\r\nDescribing the album, George Clinton said \"We had put black people in situations nobody ever thought they would be in, like the White House. I figured another place you wouldn't think black people would be was in outer space. I was a big fan of Star Trek, so we did a thing with a pimp sitting in a spaceship shaped like a Cadillac, and we did all these James Brown-type grooves, but with street talk and ghetto slang.\"\r\nDr. Dre prominently sampled the songs \"Mothership Connection (Star</p>",

The cost of recording Rocket to Russia was roughly $25,000, which was significantly higher than that of the band's two previous records. At the request of guitarist Johnny Ramone, Punk Magazine editor and illustrator John Holmstrom produced the sleeve art, a cartoonish view of the world from a rocketship with a pinhead, emblematic of the band, grabbing onto it. In 1978, the album peaked at #49 on the Billboard pop albums chart, making it one of the band's most popular releases.\r\nOn June 19, 2001, Rhino Records re-released the album.

It reached No. 2 in the United States and No. 1 in Canada and eventually received a Double Platinum certification by the RIAA, the highest during Mitchell's career. It was voted the best album of the year for 1974 in The Village Voice Jazz &amp; Pop Critics Poll.. In 2003 it was listed at No. 111 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\r\n1973 was the first year since she started recording that Mitchell did not release a new album. Her previous offering, For the Roses, was released in November 1972 to critical and commercial success, and Mitchell decided to spend the whole next year writing and recording a new album that revealed her growing interest in new sounds&#8212;particularly jazz.</p>",

Though less successful than any of The Police's albums, it managed to reach number 3 in the UK Album Charts.\r\nIt includes Sting's first hit after The Police (his first solo hit, \"Spread a Little Happiness\", was recorded while still a member of the Police), \"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\". Though the song reached number 3 in the US, it was a relative flop in the UK, where the album's track \"Russians\" (about Cold War nuclear anxieties, which had peaked in the 1980s) proved more popular.\r\nThe movie Bring on the Night documents some of the recording work that produced this album, as well as the subsequent tour.\r\nThe album is named after a dream of Sting's.\r\nThe songs include \"Children's Crusade\" (paralleling the destruction of the younger generation in World War I to the devastation brought about by heroin addiction in modern-day London); the original uptempo arrangement of The Police song \"Shadows in the Rain\"; \"We Work the Black Seam\" (about the UK miners' strike (1984-1985)); and \"Moon over</p>",

This relatively low-key but long-lived popularity led the Wall Street Journal in 2007 to dub the album, \"one of pop music's sneakiest masterpieces.\"\r\nThe Nightfly was recorded shortly after Steely Dan's final album before their extended hiatus, 1980's Gaucho.

It was recorded in 1973, its release delayed for two years. It peaked at #25 on the Billboard 200. In 2003, the album was ranked number 331 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\r\nTonight's the Night is a direct expression of grief. Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten and Young's friend and roadie Bruce Berry had both died of drug overdoses in the months before the songs were written. The title track mentions Berry by name, while Whitten's guitar and vocal work highlight \"Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown\"; the latter was recorded live in 1970. The song would later appear, unedited, on a live album from the same concerts, Live at the Fillmore East, with Whitten credited as the sole author.\r\nIt has long been speculated that an alternate version of Tonight's the Night exists. Neil Young's father, Scott Young, wrote of it in his memoir, Neil and Me:\r\nTen years after the original recording, David Briggs and I talked about Tonight's the Night, on which he had shared the producer credit with Neil.

The nine tracks of Innervisions encompass a wide range of themes and issues: from drug abuse in \"Too High,\" through social anger in \"Living for the City,\" to love in the ballads \"All in Love is Fair\" and \"Golden Lady.\"\r\nAs with many of Stevie Wonder's albums the lyrics, composition and production are almost entirely his own work, with the ARP synthesizer used prominently throughout the album. This instrument was a common motif among musicians of the time because of its ability to construct a complete sound environment. Wonder was the first black artist to experiment with this technology on a mass scale, and Innervisions was hugely influential on the subsequent future of commercial black music. He also played all or virtually all instruments on six of the album's nine tracks, making most of Innervisions a representative one-man band.\r\nThree days after the commercial release of Innervisions, on August 6, Wonder played a concert in Greenville, South Carolina.

It remains Joel's best-selling non-compilation album to date and was ranked number 67 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\r\nThe Stranger contained nine songs; \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song),\" \"She's Always a Woman,\" \"Just The Way You Are,\" \"Everybody Has A Dream,\" and \"Only The Good Die Young\" were all written prior to recording, while \"Vienna,\" \"Scenes From an Italian Restaurant,\" \"The Stranger,\" and \"Get It Right The First Time\" all came from short tunes or fragments of songs that Joel finished in the studio. Each song had stories attached to it.

The track \"A Pair of Brown Eyes\", based on an older Irish tune, went on to reach number 72 in the UK singles chart. \"The Old Main Drag\" later appeared on the soundtrack to the film My Own Private Idaho. A remastered and expanded version of Rum, Sodomy &amp; the Lash was released on 11 January 2005. The cut \"A Pistol for Paddy Garcia\", and the B-side of \"Dirty Old Town\", which only appeared on the initial cassette release, was moved to the bonus tracks. A poem by Tom Waits was also added to the expanded release.\nRum, Sodomy &amp; the Lash received positive reviews from critics. Mark Deming of Allmusic</p>",

Even though the single, &quot;Kiss&quot;, was a number one hit, the album as a whole was not well received in the U.S. Europe, however, embraced the album, and for the first time in Prince&#39;s career, European album sales eclipsed those in the U.S. This was Prince&#39;s final album released with The Revolution.<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_(Prince_album)\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Read more on Wikipedia</a>",

It was their first album and contains the singles \"Flag Day\" (#58 in the UK), \"Sheep\" (#54 in the UK), \"Happy Hour\" (#3 in the UK) and \"Think for a Minute\" (#18 in the UK).\r\nThe title refers to the band's home town of Kingston upon Hull and is in the format of a sports result. It also refers to Paul Heaton's assertion that the Housemartins were only the fourth best band in Hull. In other words, Hull had four great bands, compared to none from London.\r\nThe liner notes and lyrics reflect singer Paul Heaton's interest at that time in Christianity and Marxism. For example, the back cover of the album contains the message, \"Take Jesus - Take Marx - Take Hope\".\r\nIn 1992, the album was re-released on CD and featured four additional tracks, along with the front cover phrase, \"16 songs - 17 hits!\"\r\nThe album was re-released again on 22 June 2009, as London 0 Hull 4 Deluxe, containing a second CD of bonus tracks, B-sides and live recordings.\r\nAll songs written by Paul Heaton and Stan Cullimore, except for where noted.\r\nNew Jersey punk band Lifetime mimicked the album cover with their album Hello Bastards.\r\nThe title 'London 0 Hull 4' was used by</p>",

It was re-released in late 1994 on DGC.\r\nThe album furthers the band's move away from noise rock towards more traditional pop structures, while maintaining an aggressively experimental approach. It received universally-positive reviews. A loose concept album (like its follow-up Daydream Nation), Sister was in part inspired by the life and works of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick. (The \"sister\" of the title was Dick's fraternal twin, who died shortly after her birth, and whose memory haunted Dick his entire life.) The album features aggressive noise songs such as \"White Cross\" and \"Catholic Block,\" plus haunting noir ode \"Pacific Coast Highway\". The group has regularly played songs such as \"Schizophrenia,\" \"White Cross\" and \"Kotton Krown\" long after the album's release. CD bonus track \"Master-Dik\" is a strange rap song which mentions Ciccone Youth; its title is a reference to New York City mastering facility Masterdisk. As usual, Moore and Gordon handled most of the vocal duties on the album, but Ranaldo sang \"Pipeline/Kill Time\".\r\nThe album was recorded entirely on analog tube</p>",

The cover art is a pastiche of the artwork used on various Sound Effects records produced by the BBC during the 1970s.\r\nMusical influences noted include post-punk groups such as Wire, Gang Of Four, and Joy Division and, particularly evident in Rick Buckler's drumming, Michael Jackson's Off the Wall album. Frontman Paul Weller said at the time that he considered the album a cross between Off the Wall and Revolver. In BBC Radio 6 Music's documentary 'The Jam: Made in Britain', Paul Weller cited it as his favourite Jam album.\r\nThe album features the group's second UK number one single, \"Start!\", built around exact copies of the bassline and guitar solos from The Beatles' \"Taxman\", the lead cut on Revolver. Polydor pushed for \"Pretty Green\" to be the first single released, but Weller insisted on \"Start!\". \"Pretty Green\" includes a funk bassline and rhythm with melodic guitar breaks and psychedelic sound effects. \"That's Entertainment\" is an acoustic ballad. \"Boy About Town\" and \"Dream Time\" include horns.\r\nIn 2006, Q magazine placed the album at #15 in its list of \"40 Best Albums of the '80s\". \r\nSide One:\r\nSide Two:\r\nSound</p>",

The band continued to explore left wing political values in the album's packaging and lyrics, promoting green politics.

Records. Frustrated that its records did not see satisfactory overseas distribution, in early 1988 the band told I.R.S. head Jay Boberg that it was leaving the label. Guitarist Peter Buck also explained that his group felt it was being pressured to sell well by I.R.S., yet felt I.R.S.'s distributor MCA Records did not consider the ensemble a priority.

The album has sold 16 million copies worldwide and is widely considered as one of the best records released in the 1990s.\r\nAfter promotional duties for their previous album Out of Time in May 1991, the members of R.E.M. began work on their next album. Starting the first week of June, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and drummer Bill Berry met several times a week in a rehearsal studio to work on new material. Once a month they would take a week-long break. The musicians would often trade instruments: Buck would play mandolin, Mills would play piano or organ and Berry would play bass. Buck explained that writing without drums was productive for the band members. The band, intent on</p>",

		"body" : "<p>Like a Prayer is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on March 21, 1989 by Sire Records, three years after her previous studio album. Madonna worked with Stephen Bray, Patrick Leonard, and fellow icon Prince on the album while co-writing and co-producing all the songs. As Madonna's most introspective release at the time, Like a Prayer has been described as a confessional record. She described the album as a collection of songs \"about my mother, my father, and bonds with my family.\" The album was dedicated to her mother, who died when Madonna was young.\r\nThe album uses live instrumentation and incorporates elements of dance, funk, gospel, and soul into a more general pop style. Madonna drew from her Catholic upbringing, as seen in the album's title track and lead single \"Like a Prayer\". The lyrics deals with themes from Madonna's childhood and adolescence, such as the death of her mother in \"Promise to Try\", the importance of family in \"Keep It Together\", and her relationship with her father in \"Oh Father\". Madonna also preaches female empowerment in \"Express Yourself\". Upon its release, Like a Prayer was mostly praised by music critics. Rolling</p>",

A fusion of electronic music, hip hop, dub, '70s soul and reggae, the album established Massive Attack as one of the most innovative British bands of the 1990s and the founder of trip hop's Bristol Sound. Music critic Simon Reynolds stated that the album also marked a change in electronic/dance music, \"a shift toward a more interior, meditational sound. The songs on Blue Lines run at 'spliff' tempos &#8212; from a mellow, moonwalking 90 beats per minute ...down to a positively torpid 67 bpm.\" The group also drew inspiration from concept albums in various genres by artists such as Pink Floyd, Public Image Ltd., Billy Cobham, Herbie Hancock and Isaac Hayes.\r\nBlue Lines featured breakbeats, sampling, and rapping on a number of tracks, but the design of the album differed from traditional hip hop. Massive Attack approached the American-born hip hop</p>",

This release collected the original 1988 album with a second disc of remixes from the era.\r\nThe album's sound is noticeably different from any preceding or succeeding albums in the Madchester genre. This can be explained by the producer, Martin Hannett, who was notable for pioneering use of electronics in music. What is most noticeable production-wise on this album is the use of echo and reverb on the drum sound; while some appreciate this production work for being groundbreaking and unique, others have criticised it for the claustrophobic effects it renders on the music.\r\nSeveral of the songs on this album were later remixed. These included \"Mad Cyril\", \"Wrote For Luck\" and \"Lazyitis\". \"Mad Cyril\" was remixed into \"Mad Cyril (Hello Girls Mix)\", \"Wrote For Luck\" was remixed twice, firstly into \"WFL\" and then \"Wrote For Luck (Think About The Future Mix)\"; Vince Clarke remixed the former, Paul Oakenfold the latter. \"Lazyitis\" was remixed into \"Lazyitis (One-Armed Boxer Remix)\" which featured Country legend Karl</p>",

The album produced three hit singles: \"Alive\", \"Even Flow\", and \"Jeremy\". While Pearl Jam was accused of jumping on the grunge bandwagon at the time, Ten was instrumental in popularizing alternative rock in the mainstream. The album has been certified diamond by the RIAA in the United States. By December 2011, it had sold 13,500,000 copies, and remains Pearl Jam's most commercially successful album.\r\nGuitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament had played together in the pioneering grunge band Green River.

Compilation and remastering of the tracks took place in New York during early-to-mid 1990. A 30-page booklet was included for the vinyl and CD releases. This boxed set contains two previously unreleased tracks and a new mix. &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot; was recorded on 24 June 1969 at the BBC Maida Vale Studio. &quot;White Summer&quot; was recorded at the Playhouse Theatre, London on 27 June 1969. The &quot;Moby Dick&quot;/&quot;Bonzo&#39;s Montreux&quot; mix took place at the Atlantic Synclavier Suite in New York, in May 1990. To differentiate this release from the future Remasters box sets, some world recording industry associations have listed this under the title The Complete Collection. In an interview he gave in January 2010, Page made reference to the Boxed Set: Oh, I&#39;m now fully aware of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My awareness was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that&#39;s so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that&#39;s how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It&#39;s all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on.

It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 19&#160;November 1991 on Island Records. Stung by the criticism of their 1988 release Rattle and Hum, U2 shifted their musical direction to incorporate alternative rock, industrial, and electronic dance music influences into their sound. Thematically, the album is darker, more introspective, and at times more flippant than their previous work. Achtung Baby and the subsequent multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour were central to the group's 1990s reinvention, which replaced their earnest public image with a more lighthearted and self-deprecating one.\r\nSeeking inspiration on the eve of German reunification, U2 began recording Achtung Baby at Berlin's Hansa Studios in October 1990.

Mingus took the recording to New York where he and Max Roach dubbed in the bass lines, which were under-recorded on most of the tunes, and exchanged Mingus soloing on \"All the Things You Are.\"\nThe original plan was for the Jazz Society and the musicians to share the profits from the recording.

To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired producer Steve Albini to record In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The music was recorded quickly with few studio embellishments, and the song lyrics and album packaging incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame.\nSoon after recording was completed, rumors circulated in the press that DGC might not release the album in its original state, as the record label felt that the result was not commercially viable. Although Nirvana publicly denied the statements, the group was not fully satisfied with the sound Albini had captured. Albini declined to alter the album further, and ultimately the band hired Scott Litt to make minor changes to the album's sound and remix the singles \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\".\nUpon</p>",

Several songs on Double Nickels on the Dime were outsourced to or inspired by contemporaries, such as Black Flag's Henry Rollins and Jack Brewer of Saccharine Trust.\r\nDouble Nickels on the Dime is seen not only as Minutemen's crowning achievement, but, as critic Mark Deming notes, \"one of the very best American rock albums of the 1980s.\" The album now appears on many professional lists of the all-time best rock albums,</p>",

The album was very well received by critics and regarded among the greatest albums of the 80's. The album is now considered a classic and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best rock albums including placement as #239 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was remastered and reissued in 2008, with six additional tracks.\nThe Replacements started their career as a punk rock band but had gradually grown beyond the straightforward hardcore of initial albums like Stink. Westerberg recalls that \"playing that kind of noisy, fake hardcore rock was getting us nowhere, and it wasn't a lot of fun. This was the first time I had songs that we arranged,</p>",

The album was initially released by Sin Records to significant critical praise and commercial success. However, due to Sin's small capacity for production and distribution, the album then remained largely unavailable until it was rereleased in 2002 by Quarterstick Records, a subsidiary of Touch and Go Records.\nThe musical style represents a sharp break with the group's previous work, as fiddle, steel guitar, and harmonica are included, but the instrumentation of punk music is also present, particularly on the energetic \"Hard to be Human Again\". Tom Greenhalgh, one of the primary creative forces in the Mekons, commented that as he listened to a great deal of country music in the early 1980s and \"pretty soon the difference between the three chords of country and the three chords of punk became blurred.\" The album closes with a cover of Leon Payne's \"Lost Highway\".\nThe album's lyrics</p>",

We wanted the guitars to be cleaner, and we started experimenting with a lot of percussion.\"\nAlthough not commercially popular upon release, Crazy Rhythms was a critical success, coming in a number 17 in the Village Voice's annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll, beating out such notable critics' favorites as David Bowie's Scary Monsters, Joy Division's Closer, The Rolling Stones's Emotional Rescue, and The Specials' debut album. In their retrospective review, The Guardian wrote, \"Crazy Rhythms is one of those albums during whose course you hear the most exciting sound in music: things changing.\" Rolling Stone called it \"a landmark of jangly, guitar-driven avant-pop, and its shimmersing sound can still be heard in bands like R.E.M..\"</p>",

Initially, she sent out only two tapes, one to Tae Won Yu, from the band Kicking Giant, and another to Chris Brokaw, from the bands Come and Codeine. Multiple copies of these tapes were made, generating a buzz around Phair. Eventually, the Girly Sound tapes started to get underground hype, appearing in several independent publications.\nJohn Henderson, owner of the Chicago indie label Fell Good All Over, heard the tapes and contacted Phair. Soon she moved into his apartment and started playing her songs to him. Henderson brought in producer Brad Wood to help develop the 4-track demos into full songs.

The back cover describes it as an &quot;album of compositions and arrangements by Sun Ra played by Sun Ra and his Solar Arkestra&quot;. The album is a notable example of the radical break which Sun Ra&#39;s music of that time had made with &quot;previous notions of melody or harmony&quot;. Although heavily percussive, the music also dispenses with a continuous beat; instead Ra&#39;s music is reconstructed around &quot;interweaving compositional and improvisatory creative principles with programmatic affects&quot;. The album was originally released as The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, with a B/W sleeve designed by Ra himself. This was replaced with a new orange and red sleeve by Howard Bernstein &amp; Baby Jerry - showing Sun Ra with the third eye - and the appendage Vol. 1 added when The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume Two was released in 1966. The album was re-released on CD by ZYX-Music in the 1990s. Gene Tyranny describes the album in his review as The astonishing sessions that went light years beyond &quot;free jazz&quot; improvisation to create a music of deeply felt explosive and gentle gesture made from sound itself without reference to previous notions of melody or harmony.<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heliocentric_Worlds_of_Sun_Ra,_Volume_One\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Read more on Wikipedia</a>",

To record the album, the band used at least 42 different musicians, spent over a year in the studio, and far exceeded the original monetary advance given to the band by their record label.\nDuring the two-year span in which the album was recorded, the band was plagued by a number of creative, personal and professional problems. MCA, Warner Bros. and Steely Dan had a three-way legal battle over the rights to release the album. After the record was released, jazz musician Keith Jarrett successfully sued the band for writing credit on the title song \"Gaucho\".\nGaucho marked a significant stylistic change for Steely Dan, introducing a more minimal, groove- and atmosphere-based format. The harmonically complex chord changes that were a distinctive mark of earlier Steely Dan songs are less prominent on Gaucho, with the record's songs tending to revolve around a single rhythm or mood. Gaucho proved to be Steely Dan's final studio album before a 12-year hiatus.\nExceptional</p>",

I wrote the album while traveling cross-country by myself and there is this restless feeling throughout it... The sweet loneliness of solitary travel.\" \nDominated by Mitchell's guitar and Jaco Pastorius's distinctive fretless bass, it drew on a range of influences but was more cohesive and accessible than some of her later more jazz-oriented work. \"Coyote\", \"Amelia\" and \"Hejira\" all became concert staples shortly after Hejira's release, especially after being featured on the live</p>",

It was selected by Classic Rock in 2000 as one of the top 30 albums of the 90s and in 2003 as one of 30 greatest concept albums ever made. It was a UK Top 10 success upon its release.\nAfter trying and failing to reach a wider audience with Holidays in Eden, Marillion figured it was time to go back to their roots and make a more progressive rock-oriented album again. Brave is a concept album, based on a news story Steve Hogarth heard on the radio about a girl who was taken into police custody after being found wandering the Severn Bridge. She did not know who she was, where she came from and refused to even speak. This inspired Hogarth to write a fictional story about this girl and what might have led to her being on the Severn Bridge in this state.\nThe band relocated to Marouatte castle in France for the duration of the recording of Brave. The influence of these surroundings can be heard throughout the album in a lot of haunting atmospherics. They even went into a cave which lay in the nearby area and taped some cave sounds which were used as background ambiance on the album. This recording concept was later used by</p>",

It featured three U.S. Billboard hit singles: \"The Logical Song\" (#6), \"Goodbye Stranger\" (#15), and \"Take the Long Way Home\" (#10). In the UK, \"The Logical Song\" and the title track were both top 10 hits, the only two the group had in their native country. Breakfast in America won two Grammy Awards in 1980.\nAs with Even in the Quietest Moments..., Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson wrote most of their songs separately but conceived the theme for the album jointly. Their original concept was for an album of songs about the relationship and conflicting ideals between Davies and Hodgson themselves, to be titled Hello Stranger. Hodgson explained \"We realized that a few of the songs really lent themselves to two people talking to each other and at each other. I could be putting down his way of thinking and he could be challenging my way of seeing life [...] Our ways of life are so different, but I love him. That contrast is what makes the world go 'round and what makes Supertramp go 'round. His beliefs are a challenge to mine and my</p>",

The title is generally thought to refer to Etheridge's recent coming out as a lesbian, confirming long-standing rumors about her personal life. This is the album that gave Melissa Etheridge national recognition. The rock ballad \"Come to My Window\" was the first video from the album, with Etheridge and her guitar and actress Juliette Lewis having a nervous breakdown. This single brought the album into the public consciousness and was quickly followed by \"I'm the Only One\" (a U.S. No. 8 hit) and \"If I Wanted To\" (U.S. #16).\nThe songs on Yes I Am were recorded at A&amp;M Studios in Los Angeles, California. The album was produced by Etheridge and Hugh Padgham, who also engineered the album. Hugh Padgham had previously worked many with British artists and bands including Genesis, David Bowie, and Sting; among others. Padgham would also produce Etheridge's next album, Your Little Secret.\nThe main musicians backing Melissa were Kevin McCormick&#8212;who had co-produced Melissa's previous albums&#8212;, Mauricio Fritz Lewak, and Waddy Wachtel, and Scott</p>",

Definitely Maybe marked the beginning of Oasis' success in America, selling over one million copies there, despite only peaking at 58 on the Billboard 200. The album went on to sell over eight million copies worldwide and brought widespread critical acclaim.\nThe album, along with Blur's Parklife, helped to spur a revitalization in British pop music in the mid nineties and was embraced by critics for its optimistic themes and supposed rebuttal of the downtrodden fatalism evident in the dominant grunge music of the time. It was a seminal record of the Britpop movement and is still widely regarded as one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded, with it appearing in many 'best of' lists to this day. In June</p>",

The working title of this album was Sounds in the Grass after a series of paintings by Jackson Pollock. The album was a commercial and critical success at the height of Britpop in the mid 1990s.\nEverything Must Go, which takes its name from a play by Patrick Jones, Nicky Wire's brother, represents a change of style for the Manics. Their previous album, The Holy Bible, had been a stark, disturbing album with a minimal amount of instrumentation whilst this album embraces synths and strings, has a more commercial feel and fits with the Britpop movement that was prevalent at the time. The lyrical focus of the album is also shifted, due in part to Edwards' departure. Instead of introspective and autobiographical tracks such as \"4st 7lb\", Wire's predilection for historical and political themes dominates.

Following the massive worldwide commercial success of his first album Faith, this release found Michael awash in an identity crisis, with a sudden bid to quickly create a new image for himself as a serious-minded artist, while still generating sales.\nSeemingly torn at first between his previous role as the camera-friendly media darling and his new role as abhorrer of all things visual, the album's title indicated his desire to be taken more seriously (although cameras were sometimes allowed into the recording studio, the results ending up on an MTV Rockumentary soon afterward). The album was deemed by many as a reverse-psychological tactic to generate renewed interest from an ever larger (and more adult) fan base, but ended up a commercial disappointment compared to Michael's time in Wham! and debut album Faith.\nThe album was Michael's final album of all-new material on Columbia Records until 2004's Patience. It was the album's disappointing sales in the U.S. that led to Michael's legal battles against Sony Music,</p>",

With this album, Underworld expanded on their progressive palette, while developing their signature sound of abrasive beats and anthemic melodies. The unusual name of the album derives from a comment made by member Rick Smith's six-year-old nephew, Simon Prosser, when asked on his progress at infant school, the level of schooling attended by four- to seven-year-old children in the United Kingdom. Second Toughest featured the single \"Pearl's Girl\". The re-issue featured the band's best known single, \"Born Slippy .NUXX\".\nThe album opens with Underworld's third longest track to date; the multi-song suite \"Juanita : Kiteless : To Dream of Love\", which features all three parts intersecting each other at various points during the piece. The loungy, drum and bass track \"Banstyle\" follows, alongside its downtempo, half-speed counterpart \"Sappy's Curry\". The rest of the record showcases advancements in the Underworld sound: both \"Rowla\" and \"Pearl's Girl\" feature club-ready abrasive beats and basslines, while \"Blueski\" and \"Stagger\" incorporate live acoustic guitar</p>",

Diane Charlemagne contributed the bulk of the vocals.\nReleased on Pete Tong's FFRR label, the album reached #7 in the charts. Timeless was simultaneously released as a double album and single album.

Produced by Elvis Costello, the album captures the disaffection and anger felt by the youth of the UK&#39;s &quot;concrete jungle&quot; - a phrase borrowed from Bob Marley&#39;s 1972 album Catch A Fire but equally apposite used here to describe the grim, violent inner cities of 1970s Britain. Musically, the album encapsulates the wave of British ska, greatly reworking the original sound of 1960s Jamaican ska. The music shares the infectious energy and humour of the original sound, but injects new-found anger and punk sensibility. The resulting sound is considerably less laid-back and &quot;Caribbean&quot; sounding than original ska, and dispensed with much of the percussion and the larger horn sections used in the older variety. The Specials also brought guitar to the front of the mix; it had often been a secondary instrument in Jamaican ska. The album features a mixture of original material and several covers of classic Jamaican ska tracks, a debt which went uncredited on the 1979 release. Many songs on The Specials&#39;",

It was the band's final studio album featuring vocalist/drummer Phil Collins, who would eventually leave Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo work.\nWe Can't Dance was Genesis' first studio album in five years, following the international success of Invisible Touch in 1986. We Can't Dance reached No.1 in the UK and No.4 in the US, selling several million copies (including 4 million in the US alone). The album also spawned several hit singles, including \"No Son of Mine\", \"Hold on My Heart\", \"I Can't Dance\" and \"Jesus He Knows Me\", the latter two supported by humorous videos. Two songs were cut from the album, because \"there wasn't enough room on the record.\" These two songs are \"On the Shoreline\", and \"Hearts on Fire\". Both songs were released as B-Sides.\nContrary to popular belief, \"Since I Lost You\" is not about a broken relationship. The lyrics were written by Phil</p>",

After the release of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to solidify her future in the music business, by building on the success of the first album. She decided to become one of the record producers, but Warner Bros. was not ready to give her the artistic freedom that she wanted. Nile Rodgers was chosen as the primary producer of the album, due to his work with David Bowie.\nThe album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic band mates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange of their help.

As the band became increasingly successful and featured regularly in the UK Indie Chart, a first studio album was announced in 1983 for the following year. Eldritch estimated the production costs at &#163;40,000, a sum which exceeded the financial capabilities of an indie band. Around the same time talks with interested record labels began.\nIn October 1983 guitarist Ben Gunn left and at the end of the year, through CBS Records who were interested in signing The Sisters, was replaced by former Dead or Alive member Wayne Hussey. Hussey soon realised serious tensions within the group: &#8222;I started rehearsing with Craig and Gary in the cellar of Eldritch's place. It was very primitive, we did a lot of rehearsing but never with Andrew. [...] Gary was becoming disillusioned</p>",

During his first meeting with the group, Vig told the band that he wanted to tighten the song arrangement and focus on crafting the guitar sounds. Vig quickly landed the producer job for the record. During a visit to the apartment of Sonic Youth members Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon, Moore told Vig he wanted the album to sound like an obscure Mecht Mensch single Vig had produced. The band sent a series of cassette tapes to Vig in late 1991 featuring its new compositions. Vig was pleased but also uncertain, as the tapes consisted of long instrumentals where the producer was unable to discern the song structures. The second batch of cassettes Vig received demonstrated that the band had performed some self-editing with its compositions.\nVig moved to New York City for three months in early 1992, booking studio time at the Magic Shop studio.

Inspired by the band's experiences on the Zoo TV Tour, Zooropa expanded on many of the tour's themes of technology and media oversaturation. The record continued the group's experimentation with alternative rock, electronic dance music, and electronic sound effects that began with their previous album, Achtung Baby, in 1991.\nU2 began writing and recording for Zooropa in Dublin in February 1993, during a six-month break between legs of the Zoo TV Tour. The record was originally intended as an EP to promote the \"Zooropa\" leg of the tour that was to begin in May 1993, but during the sessions, the group decided to extend the record to a full-length LP. Pressed for time, U2 wrote and recorded at a rapid pace, with songs originating from many sources.

Written and produced by Sly Stone, Fresh is more upbeat than its predecessor, the landmark There's a Riot Goin' On, but still retains much of Riot's dark, funky feel.\nThe album's biggest hit was \"If You Want Me to Stay\". Other notable tracks include \"Frisky\" and \"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be),\", a cover of Doris Day's Academy Award-winning song from Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, sung here by Rose Stone. \"Que Sera, Sera\" is notable as the only cover song issued on an original Family Stone album. The cover photo is by Richard Avedon.\nAs with There's a Riot Goin' On, Stone held on to the Fresh masters well beyond the record's official release, constantly remixing and re-recording the tracks. As a result, alternate and significantly different versions of at least ten songs from the album are known to exist. In 1991, Sony Music, by then owner of the Epic catalog, accidentally issued a sequencing of Fresh on CD featuring alternate takes of every song except \"In Time\", which remained unchanged.

Morrison recorded the album shortly after his divorce from wife Janet (Planet) Rigsbee. With his broken marriage in the past, Morrison visited Ireland on holiday for new inspiration, arriving on 20 October 1973 (with his fiancee at the time, Carol Guida). While there he wrote&#8212;in less than three week's time&#8212; the songs included on the album (except \"Bulbs\", \"Country Fair\" and \"Come Here My Love\").\r\nIt has been compared to Astral Weeks with the same \"stream of consciousness\" lyrics but musically it is more celtic, acoustic and heavily influenced by Morrison's Irish trip. It has been called a genuinely underground album that he seemed to disown quickly after recording and has been referred to as Morrison's \"forgotten masterpiece\".\r\nDuring the summer months of 1973, Morrison had embarked on a three month tour with his eleven-piece band, The Caledonia Soul Orchestra. Although the resulting concerts and live album, It's Too Late to Stop Now have come to be known as a performing high for Morrison, the tour was physically and emotionally exhausting.</p>",

It was released as the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film of the same name. Widely considered a classic of 1970s soul and funk music, Super Fly was a nearly immediate hit. Its sales were bolstered by two million-selling singles, \"Freddie's Dead\" (#2 R&amp;B, #4 Pop) and the title track (#5 R&amp;B, #8 Pop). Super Fly is one of the few soundtracks to out-gross the film it accompanied.\nSuper Fly, along with Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, was one of the pioneering soul concept albums, with its then-unique socially aware lyrics about poverty and drug abuse making the album stand out. The film and the soundtrack may be perceived as dissonant, since the Super Fly film holds rather ambiguous views on drug dealers, whereas Curtis Mayfield's position is far more critical. Like What's Going On, the album was a surprise hit that record executives felt had little chance at significant sales. Due to its success, Mayfield was tapped for several film soundtracks over the course of the decade.\nSuper Fly was originally released in 1972 on Curtom Records in both LP and 8-track</p>",

It's the sound of an artist being given the keys to the kingdom and returning with art.\" The album emerged from a demanding recording process: often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances, edited them down heavily, then arranged the remaining pieces into an album using digital equipment. The end product includes elements of rock, jazz, classical, and ambient music. The album was released on the Parlophone record label, an imprint of EMI.\nCritics often view Spirit of Eden as a departure from Talk Talk's previous albums.

It is important to note that no matter what, even in the album&#8217;s closing track, where the titular characters are being relocated to 'identical little boxes', there isn&#8217;t a hint of complacency or resignation; they instead pledge defiance by refusing to change.\" Musical</p>",

The album's third single \"Special\" was further nominated the following year for Best Rock Song and for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.\nBuilding on framework sound and style Garbage established on their debut set, Version 2.0 featured musical references to the sixties, seventies and eighties, songs featuring live strings, over 100 recorded tracks and interpolations of both the Beach Boys and The Pretenders.

Peaking at No. 3 on the U.S. charts and No. 5 in the United Kingdom, it was the band's first platinum album, eventually selling over 5 million copies. In July 1978, the album won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Recording. In 2003, the album was ranked number 145 on Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list.\nDonald Fagen has said the title of the album comes from the name of a Korean woman who married the brother of a high-school friend of his. The cover photo by Hideki Fujii features Japanese model/actress Sayoko Yamaguchi.\nThe album features several leading session musicians. The eight-minute-long title track features jazz-based changes and a solo by saxophonist Wayne Shorter.\nAja is the subject of one of the Classic Albums, a series of documentaries about the making of famous albums. The documentary includes a song-by-song study of the album (the only omission being \"I Got the News,\" which is played during the closing credits), interviews with Steely Dan co-founders</p>",

The change prompted criticism from some influential figures in the folk community &#8211; Sing Out! editor Irwin Silber complained that Dylan had \"somehow lost touch with people\" and was caught up in \"the paraphernalia of fame\".\nDespite the album's thematic shift, Dylan performed the entirety of Another Side of Bob Dylan as he had previous records &#8211; solo. In addition to his usual acoustic guitar and harmonica, Dylan provides piano on one selection, \"Black Crow Blues\". Another Side of Bob Dylan reached No. 43 in the US (although it eventually went gold), and peaked at No. 8 on the UK charts in 1965.\nThroughout 1963, Dylan worked on a novel and a play.

The recording was the first to introduce a wider audience to Havens's rich baritone vocals and the full-sound of Havens's distinct guitar style (thumb-chorded and played in open D tuning).\nThe album was initially released on vinyl in 1967 on Verve Forecast, a newly formed folk section at the Verve division of MGM Records. It was re-released as a compact disk in 1993 on Polygram.

Many Deadheads consider this era of the Dead to be the experimental apex of the band's history. It is also the first album with Tom Constanten as an official member of the band. Rolling Stone, upon reviewing the album, mentioned that \"no other music sustains a lifestyle so delicate and loving and lifelike.\" The album was certified gold by the RIAA on May 13, 1997.\nThe title of the album is a palindrome created by cover artist Rick Griffin and lyricist Robert Hunter. According to the audio version of the Rock Scully memoir, Living with the Dead (read by the author and former Dead co-manager himself), the title is pronounced \"ox-oh-mox-oh-ah\". The words \"Grateful Dead\" on the front of the album, written in large, flowing capital letters, are an ambigram that can also be read \"we ate the acid\". The artwork around the bottom edge of the album cover depicts several phallic representations.\nIn 1991 Rolling Stone selected Aoxomoxoa as having the eighth best album cover of all time.

It received almost universally positive reviews, making many critics' year-end \"best of\" lists, and pointed Harris' career in a somewhat different direction, where she would incorporate a harder, albeit plaintive edge that would single her out from the complacent, country music mainstream. As a career-redefining album, Wrecking Ball was likened to Marianne Faithfull's 1979 Broken English album and Johnny Cash's later American Recordings.

Significant Other was coproduced by Terry Date and Limp Bizkit.\nThe album was associated with controversy over the band's live performance at Woodstock 1999, in which violence erupted during a performance of the song \"Break Stuff\". However, the controversy did not affect the album's success, as Significant Other was the subject of high commercial sales, peaking at #1 on the Billboard 200. Critical reaction to the album was also favorable, with critics responding well to the album's unique sound and the band's performance, which was considered to be an improvement over that of the band's debut.\nFollowing the radio success of the band's cover of George Michael's \"Faith\", the band was determined to record the follow-up to their first album in order to show that they weren't a \"Korn ripoff\" or a cover band; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from their newfound fame.

It was produced by Pierre Marchand in Montreal, and released in October 1993 in Canada, and in early 1994 in the rest of the world.\nThe album was an immediate hit in Canada, where McLachlan was already an established star. Over the next two years, it became her breakthrough album internationally as well. However, in some countries, most notably the United States, the album was a steady seller that stayed in the middle ranges of the pop charts for almost two years, rather than the #1 smash that McLachlan would achieve with 1997's Surfacing. As of November 2003, the album has sold 2.8 million copies in the United States.\n\"Possession\", the album's first single, is written from the point of view of an obsessed fan. Following the album's release, a fan named Uwe Vandrei sued McLachlan for songwriting credit, claiming that his letters were used as the basis of the song. The case never made it to trial as Vandrei was found dead of apparent suicide in November 1994.\nSome editions contain an album version of McLachlan's 1995 single used for The Brothers McMullen soundtrack, \"I Will Remember You\".

About people who tell others what to do and what to believe. They switch off people's minds and control the masses. It gives me a feeling of isolation, when I think about it.

This was done twice for each song, resulting in four acoustic guitar tracks (two from Matthews, two from Reynolds) all playing the same part on each song.

The song \"Luckie\" was derived from an earlier composition Nyro had played at her audition for Verve Records in 1966. Before she signed to Columbia Records, Verve had already planned to release the album, under the title Soul Picnic. The new title is a play on two songs from the album: The name Eli is from \"Eli's Comin'\"; while the \"thirteenth confession\" is derived from \"The Confession\", being the thirteenth track on the album.\nThe album saw its actual release in 1968 on the Columbia label and became one of the year's underground successes. One critic noted, \"the hottest sounds of that summer were Sgt. Pepper and the Laura Nyro record.\" The album was written entirely by Nyro, arranged by Charlie Calello and produced by both. On Nyro's insistence, the album's lyric sheet (which itself was a rarity for records in 1968) was perfumed, and fans have reported that it still has a pleasant aroma.\nThe album's themes are of passion, love, romance, death, and drugs, and the songs are</p>",

This was further compounded by reluctance from the record label, Bearsville, to release a new album when his song \"Hello It's Me\" from Something/Anything? remained strong on the singles charts.\nOther lore from Todd is the battle with Rundgren over the label's desire to release the song \"Izzat Love?\" as a single.

With this album, the band abandoned the lo-fi sound displayed on Slanted and Enchanted (as well as their drummer, Gary Young). During the tour for Slanted, the band added percussionist Bob Nastanovich and bassist Mark Ibold; partway through this album's recording sessions, Gary Young was replaced by Steve West. The album featured the band at its most easily accessible, and the single \"Cut Your Hair\" was the band's closest brush with mainstream success. As of 2007, the album has sold almost 500,000 copies and was a UK Top 20 hit upon release. Although it was not so successful in the US charts, it has since been critically acclaimed across the US music press as a classic alternative rock album.\nThe album was reissued on October 26, 2004 by Matador Records under the name Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA's Desert Origins. The re-released version contains two discs: the first is the original album as well as B-sides and compilation tracks from that era. The second disc is a collection of previously unreleased tracks featuring former drummer Gary Young and live BBC Sessions.\nThe collection features forty-nine tracks,</p>",

Mick Jagger felt invigorated by the provocations and was determined to answer them lyrically. It helped, however, that almost all the punks had, openly or not, idolised the Stones in the 1960s and were heavily influenced by the band's rebellious records from that era.\nAt least as important for the band's reinvigoration was the addition of Ronnie Wood to the line-up, as Some Girls was the first album recorded with him as a full member. His guitar playing style meshed with, and was similar to, that of Keith Richards. Wood's slide guitar playing would become one of the band's hallmarks, and his unconventional uses of the instrument are prominent on Some Girls.</p>",

The band continued recording at, among other studios, Abbey Road Studios in London. The Man Who initially looked as though it would mirror the release of Good Feeling. Although it entered the charts at No. 7, with little radio play of its singles, it quickly slipped down. Worse, many critics who had raved about the rocky Good Feeling rubbished the album for the band's move into more melodic, melancholic material (for example, \"Travis will be best when they stop trying to make sad, classic records\" - NME). However, when the album slipped as far as No. 19, it stopped. Word of mouth and increasing radio play of the single \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" increased awareness of the band and the album began to rise back up the charts.

The record was recorded from concerts in Detroit, Michigan, Wildwood, New Jersey, Cleveland, Ohio and Davenport, Iowa.\nDespite their reputation and success as a live act, which emphasized theatrics as much as it did music, their notoriety did not translate to increased record sales. Fans told the band that their albums were not capturing how the band sound live, so the band decided to release a live album. Kiss was essentially surviving on then-manager Bill Aucoin's American Express card. Complicating matters was the fact that their label, Neil Bogart's Casablanca Records, was having financial difficulties of its own stemming from a major misstep.

Recorded at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, the album was written with the intent of creating solid songs as opposed to a cohesive album. As a result, Nimrod is noted for its musical diversity and experimentation, and contains elements of folk, surf rock, and ska. The lyrical themes discussed on the record include maturity, personal reflection, and fatherhood.\nThe album peaked at number ten on the Billboard U.S. charts and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record also was certified triple platinum in Australia and double platinum in Canada. Nimrod also received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Armstrong's songwriting on the record.

The plan was to release a live album to give Kiss some much deserved time off before recording the album that would become Love Gun later that Fall. Kramer finished work on the album, but Casablanca Records and Kiss deemed it unusable, and the band forged ahead with the Love Gun sessions.\nMost of the live tracks on Alive II were recorded during the band's August 26&#8211;28 shows at the Los Angeles Forum while on their Love Gun tour. The 3:00 PM soundchecks at the August 26 and 27 shows were recorded, and later used on the album (i.e. \"Tomorrow And Tonight\") with crowd noise being dubbed in later. \"Beth\" and \"I Want You\" were lifted from the aborted Japanese live album and used on the finished Alive II.

		"body" : "<p>Deserter's Songs is the fourth studio album by the Buffalo, New York-based rock band Mercury Rev, released in late September 1998. British music magazine NME named Deserter's Songs album of the year for 1998. Limited edition copies of the album came in a brown cardboard envelope-like package, with a stamp on the cover postmarked with the release date, as well as two art postcards.\nThe success of this album was a pleasant surprise for the band. After the commercial failure of See You on the Other Side, which Donahue considered to be the band's best album, they decided to make one more record entirely for themselves, ignoring commercial influences, and expecting to split up shortly afterward. Surprisingly, Deserter's Songs was their most successful album, and made them big celebrities in the UK and Europe, also making a smaller mark in the US.\nThe hidden track at the end of \"Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp\" is played on the Tettix Wave Accumulator, an instrument built by Donahue and Grasshopper. Reportedly, two versions of the instrument exist&#8212;one for recording that takes up half of Grasshopper's basement, and a smaller one for the road.\nA 10th anniversary edition of the album was rumored</p>",

The release cemented Morrissey's success in the US, giving him a top 20 album and his first hit single there with the song \"The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get\". This was Morrissey's second solo album to reach the top of the charts in Britain, the first being Viva Hate.\nVauxhall and I reflects the course Morrissey's life has taken. With its blend of guitar rock, largely acoustic ballads, and wry classic rock, Vauxhall and I stands in stark contrast to Morrissey's other work. It is distinguished by its ironic and introspective nature as well as its sombre and emotional mood.\nMorrissey had recently suffered the loss of three people close to him: Mick Ronson, Tim Broad, and Nigel Thomas, which may have had the cumulative effect of giving Vauxhall and I somewhat of a funeral feel. Indeed, just two years later Morrissey acknowledged that he felt at the time that this was going to be his last album, and that not only was it the best album he'd ever made but that he would never be able to top it in the future.\nThe lead single off the album, \"The More You Ignore</p>",

This theme was reflected in the lyrics of the album's title track:\nThe title of The Grand Illusion had been considered dating back to the 1975 album Equinox.\nThe track \"Miss America\" was guitarist James Young's scathing attack on the Miss America pageant. The idea for the song came to him in the middle of the night. Its sole riff was inspired by the Jethro Tull song \"Minstrel in the Gallery\".\nThe album cover art is an homage to a painting by Ren&#233; Magritte entitled \"Le Blanc-Seing\". It features a photo of keyboardist Dennis DeYoung on the body of a horse.</p>",

According to Rolling Stone writer Rob Kemp, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. \"links funk metal to the rap metal\". \"Magic Medicine\" incorporates elements of trip hop, sampling a recorded reading of a children's book. The song \"Vitamin\" appears in the film Final Destination 2.\nCritics praised the album's diversity of styles. Pitchfork Media wrote that Incubus \"successfully combines all sorts of [music genres] without sounding like a mess\". Allmusic reviewer David Thomas wrote that \"The numerous styles on the album don't always blend perfectly, but they create a solid sound that defines the band. Incubus also manages to make their songs upbeat and danceable as well as tunes to headbang to. An admirable feat in a genre that tends to reward decibel levels instead of quality.\" Drop-D Magazine reviewer Darren</p>",

In 1995, they entered the studio to work on their debut album with producer, Charles Fisher (Air Supply, Moving Pictures, 1927). In March 1997, the duo's self-titled debut album, Savage Garden, entered the Australian charts at No.&#160;1 and peaked there for a total of 19 weeks. The album was released internationally two weeks later. The album reached No.&#160;3 on the US Billboard 200 and was certified gold by RIAA.\nIn September, Savage Garden won a record ten ARIA Awards from 13 nominations for the album and associated singles. As of 2005, Savage Garden had been certified 12&#215; platinum in Australia, 7&#215; platinum in the</p>",

His first album under his new contract with Sony Music, it was also Jackson's first album to not be produced by longtime collaborator Quincy Jones, who had agreed to split after the final recording sessions for Jackson's 1987 album, Bad. Dangerous has sold over 32 million albums worldwide, 7 million albums were shipped in the United States alone, and has been cited as one of the best-selling albums of all time. The album produced four top ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 including one number-one. Similar to the musician's previous material, the album's music features elements of R&amp;B, pop and rock while also incorporating a newer genre, new jack swing, after the inclusion of producer Teddy Riley to the project.\nDangerous took over a year in production, starting in June of 1990 and ending in October of 1991. Lyrical themes expressed in the album included racism, poverty, paranoia, romance, the welfare of children and the world and self-improvement, topics Jackson had recorded before.

Released in 1968, the album influenced glam rock and power pop artists such as David Bowie and Big Star.\nThe track \"Open My Eyes\" has been said to be the inspiration behind one of the earliest songs written by KISS, \"Love Her All I Can\", a song originally intended for the pre-KISS band Wicked Lester. The song would appear on the 1975 KISS album Dressed to Kill. \"Open My Eyes\" was accompanied by a promo video, directed by Ray Dennis Steckler. The Nazz album cover is also rumored to have inspired that of KISS' debut as well as Queen's Queen II.\nThe album also featured the original version of what would become frontman Todd Rundgren's signature song, \"Hello It's Me\", which Rundgren himself would re-record several years later as a solo single for his famous double album, Something/Anything?.\nNazz peaked at #118 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, while the original \"Hello It's Me\" single peaked at #66 on the Pop Singles chart.\nThe album was remastered and rereleased in 2006 with bonus tracks by Sanctuary Records Group.\nAll songs written by Todd Rundgren, except where noted.\nTodd Rundgren later recorded a solo version of \"Hello</p>",

Because of the requirement of a pipe organ, this song is rarely played live by Muse, perhaps the most notable occasions being at Muse's charity gig at the Royal Albert Hall and during the Hullabaloo concert in Paris.

Hybrid Theory takes its title from the previous name of the band.\nFour singles were released from the album: \"One Step Closer\", \"Papercut\", the Grammy Award-winning \"Crawling\" and \"In the End\", the latter which was responsible for launching Linkin Park into mainstream popularity.

Much of the album was written by Cuomo while he was away at school. To assist in capturing the group's live sound, Weezer decided against hiring a producer for Pinkerton.\nThe record used a darker, more abrasive sound with themes drawn from Cuomo's disillusionment with the rock lifestyle.

Like the opera, the record contains many references to Japan and Japanese culture.\nPinkerton debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 and fell far short of sales expectations after the success of the band's debut, Weezer (1994).

Recorded at Transporterraum in New York City with producer Gordon Raphael, the album was first released on July&#160;30, 2001 in Australia, with RCA Records as the primary label. The record entered the UK Albums Chart at number two and peaked at number&#160;33 on the U.S. Billboard&#160;200, going on to achieve platinum status in several markets. \"Hard to Explain\", \"Last Nite\", and \"Someday\" were released as singles.\nFor the album, The Strokes strived to capture a simple rock sound that was not significantly enhanced in the studio. Building on the work of their 2001 debut EP, The Modern Age, the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during the recording sessions, while songwriter Julian Casablancas continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth. Following the completion of Is This It, The Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy for being too sexually explicit and was replaced for the U.S. market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the September&#160;11 terrorist attacks.\nPromoted by the music</p>",

This resulted in dozens of different versions of over thirty different songs circulating on the Internet before the album was released.\nThe idea was to keep solid communication open with their fan base on their official message board as well as, more crucially, on unofficial message boards such as the Rivers Correspondent Board (which was closed to the public at Cuomo's request, chiefly so that members of the press could not gain access).

In addition to being Springsteen's first studio album in seven years, it was also his first with the E Street Band in 18 years. It is centered around Springsteen's reflections on the September 11, 2001 attacks.\nUpon its release, The Rising was a critical and commercial success, and hailed as the triumphant return for Springsteen. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of over 520,000 copies. With this, Springsteen became the oldest person to achieve a first-week sales of over a half of a million copies in the United States. The album also garnered a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2003; although nominated for the Album of the Year award as well, it was beaten by Norah Jones' debut album Come Away with Me. Title song \"The Rising\" was also a Grammy nominee and recipient.\nFor the year 2002, The Rising was one of only two albums to receive Rolling Stone's highest rating &#8211; five stars &#8211; the other being Beck's Sea Change. The magazine also ranked the album #15 on its list of 100 Best Albums of the Decade. In 2012, it was rated #424 on</p>",

After hearing the song, he said it was \"a good beginning\"; the name stuck. The name has also been translated as \"An alright start.\"\nSigur R&#243;s won an Iceland Music Award and the 2001 Shortlist Music Prize for this album.\nWhile released to little fanfare, the album quickly gained radio exposure in Iceland, and spent the autumn of 1999 climbing the Icelandic album charts, finally resting at the top</p>",

It was released to wide critical acclaim and hailed by critics as a departure from their previous guitar-heavy alternative rock sound, into a more layered and intricately arranged work.\nThe album was considered to mark a change in the course for the band, with more traditional catchy melodies and accessible-sounding music (their previous album, 1997's Zaireeka, was a quadruple album of experimental sounds meant to be played on four separate stereo systems simultaneously) and lyrics that were more serious and thoughtful in content.\nThe album was noted for its fusion of ordinary rock instruments, electronic beats and synthesizers. Its large, layered, symphonic sound has also earned it a reputation as the Pet Sounds of the 1990s from a few critics.\nThe cover artwork of the album is a modified version of a photograph taken by Lawrence Schiller for a 1966 Life magazine article on LSD.\nDespite never reaching the Billboard 200, The Soft Bulletin was lauded by critics and fans alike and topped numerous \"Best of 1999\" lists.

These songs were more typical of earlier Pogues albums, mostly fast and heavily textured. The album was also the first by the band to utilize a complete drum kit.\nAlso prominent were the ballads \"Thousands Are Sailing\", \"The Broad Majestic Shannon\", and the Christmas hit, \"Fairytale of New York\", a duet with Kirsty MacColl. \"Streets of Sorrow/Birmingham Six\" showed the political side to their music, the first part being about the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and the second half</p>",

As a result, the songs sound far more sparkling without becoming rough or rushed.\nLyrically, singer Hofstede delves into his childhood memories, conjuring up a vision of childhood life in the Dutch 1950s and 1960s. The album cover reflects this, featuring actual historical Children's Benefit stamps. Even though they resemble young versions of all four band members, they are in fact real Dutch stamps from 1951.\nIn the Dutch Mountains was the Nits' most successful album to date and the first to gain a UK release. Its lead single and title track was a reasonable hit across the European continent, and is considered their signature song. In the Netherlands, two more singles were pulled off the album, \"J.O.S.

Many of the songs deal with their decline, his response to loss, and coming to terms with suddenly becoming the only living member of his family (his father having died of a heart attack in 1982; Everett, then 19 years old, was the first to discover his body).\nThough much of the album is, on its surface, bleak, its underlying message is that of coping with some of life's most difficult occurrences. The record begins with \"Elizabeth on the Bathroom Floor\", a sparse piece composed of one of his deceased sister's final diary entries. Later, the album's emotional climax is reached in two tracks: \"Climbing to the Moon\", which draws upon E's experiences visiting his sister at a mental-health facility shortly before her death; and \"Dead of Winter\", a song about his mother's painful radiation treatment and slow succumbing.

The album was recorded at Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire from January to March 1995.\nThe album was a major shift in direction from previous album Troublegum, moving away from punk-metal to create a broad epic cinematic soundscape, with the songs being linked by ambient music pieces from Belfast D.J.

The album reached number 9 in the UK Albums Chart.\nThe album was released on limited edition red 12&#8221; vinyl, CD and Cassette.\nThe Japanese version did not include the \"insanity\" links by David Holmes, but included two bonus tracks:</p>",

The story revolves around the fictitious character Jackie Cane who leaves her identical twin sister in order to become a professional singer. Driven to the brink of insanity by the pressures of fame, Jackie quits show business and returns home to attempt reconciliation with her sister. But, still bitter from years of being put last, her sister kills both of them with a poisoned Last Supper.

Recorded in less than one week at Easley-McCain Recording in Memphis, Tennessee, and produced by frontman and guitarist Jack White, it was the band's final record released independently on Sympathy for the Record Industry. Bolstered by the hit single \"Fell in Love with a Girl\", the record propelled The White Stripes into early commercial popularity and critical success. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 497 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nContinuing the stripped-down garage rock nature of the duo, White Blood Cells attempts to do away with the band's blues rock influences, instead displaying a more raw, basic, and primitive rock and roll sound.

Its sound also became hugely influential in modern hip hop production, while the group members' explicit, humorous, and free-associative lyrics have served as a template for many subsequent hip hop records.

In a departure from Primal Scream's earlier hedonistic recordings, the band took a more political stance, attacking government, police, and multinational corporations. A free postcard championing the cause of the \"Free Satpal Ram Campaign\" and encouraging fans to participate was included with initial copies of the album's UK release.\nThe album is also notable for being the final LP release on the influential British label Creation Records. The track \"Accelerator\" was later lifted from the album to become the last single to be released on the label. Although Gary Mounfield joined the band in 1997 and recorded a selection of tracks on the album Vanishing Point, it was the first time he shared songwriting credits with the band and his first full album since his time in The Stone Roses.\nIn 2001, Q magazine named it as one of the \"50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time\".\nXTRMNTR was critically acclaimed upon release and is recognized as one of the two definitive Primal Scream albums - the other being Screamadelica. NME magazine (12/30/00, p.&#160;77) rated XTRMNTR #2 in its \"Top 50 Albums Of The Year 2000\", and later at the NME</p>",

Their tour promoting the album was unofficially named F.U.C.K. 'n' Live.

The album was an attempt by the group to strip down their well-known lush, psychedelic sound in order to be able to better perform the songs in concert. In order to be able to play as many new songs as possible from their new album live, the group decided (temporarily) to abandon their method of heavy overdubbing for A Question of Balance.\nFor the first time, The Moody Blues used political strife as a basis for songwriting with the British number two hit in May 1970, \"Question\", which dealt with the controversy resulting from the ongoing Vietnam War.\nReleased in 1970, the album reached #1 in the United Kingdom and #3 in the United States. However, the group would abandon the stripped-down sounds of A Question of Balance for the lusher sounds of their next two albums, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour and Seventh Sojourn.\nIn March 2006 the album was remastered into SACD format and repackaged with six extra tracks.\nIn 2008 a remaster for standard audio CD was issued with the same bonus tracks.\nBonus tracks on the SACD version:</p>",

While both were big successes and would have ordinarily inspired albums to support them, Starr declined to follow through, preferring to concentrate on acting during this period.\nIn early 1973, Starr decided the time was right to begin&#8212;in his mind&#8212;his first proper solo album, despite its two predecessors. Having already used Richard Perry to arrange one of the tracks on Sentimental Journey, Starr asked Perry to produce the sessions, which began that March.\nAs soon as Starr sent word to all his musician</p>",

Relocating his family failed to deter fans from intruding on his property and he became increasingly wary of how other residents viewed him. \"The neighbors hated us\", Dylan recalled. \"To them, it must've seemed like I was something out of a carnival show.\"\nTo his chagrin, the press continued to promote him as the spokesman of his generation. \"I wasn't the toastmaster of any generation\", Dylan wrote, \"and that notion needed to be pulled up by its</p>",

Maddy Prior was experiencing voice problems so she spoke to Gay Woods, a founding member who had left the band after the first album, to rejoin. Woods initially resisted this move, since she had not performed publicly for some time, but Prior eventually prevailed and Woods returned to the band. The result was only the second Steeleye Span album to feature two female singers, which was used to very good effect on the ironic \"Old Maid in the Garrett\" and to a lesser extent on \"The Prickly Bush\" and \"The Cutty Wren\". Both Prior and Woods provide lead vocals on different songs. Prior&#8217;s voice troubles are reflected in her musical choices on this album; she generally sings less powerfully and in a lower range, but still effectively. Woods also introduced a few Irish elements to the band&#8217;s repertoire, including the \"Old Maid in the Garrett/Tam Lin reel\" and her bodhran.

The album was a huge success in the UK, the tenth-best selling album of 2003, and the 49th best-selling album of the 2000s in the UK.\r\n\"Bad Day\" was a demo version in 1986, a Life's Rich Pageant outtake when Bill Berry was still in the band, and was re-recorded for this compilation. \"Animal\" was a recent song written for their upcoming studio album. Similarly, \"All the Right Friends\", originally written in the early 1980s, had been re-recorded by the band for use in Cameron Crowe's 2001 film Vanilla Sky. Finally, \"The Great Beyond\" was initially issued in 1999 as part of Milo&#353; Forman's film on Andy Kaufman, Man on the Moon. It ended up becoming the band's biggest UK hit, with a No. 3 peak, in early 2000. This, the third inclusion of the song on an official release, is the only unedited version.

Because of tensions with Mustaine, McGovney left the band. Castro Valley-born bassist Cliff Burton was recruited as his replacement. Mustaine was fired in April 1983 for his drug and alcohol problems, overly aggressive behavior and clashes with bandmates. After Mustaine's departure, Metallica recruited Kirk Hammett, who previously played for Exodus and was a one time student of Joe Satriani. The band started recording the album with Hammett, whose guitar solos on the album were partially based on Mustaine's original solos (the first four bars of most solos were written by Mustaine), barely a month later. Mustaine then formed the band Megadeth, which also achieved multi-million selling success.\nDespite their differences, Mustaine's contributions to the early years of Metallica were still acknowledged; he</p>",

Many of the recordings feature the keyboard work of Nicky Hopkins and the backing vocals of Ray Davies's wife, Rasa. Two hit singles are included: \"Waterloo Sunset\" and \"Death of a Clown\". In 2003 it was ranked number 288 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\nRay Davies's lyrics on the album deal with English-inspired subject matter, including the harpsichord-laden \"Two Sisters\", the lazy shuffle \"End of the Season\", and the sardonic \"David Watts\".\nAs Ray Davies had assumed control over production after the departure of Shel Talmy, Something Else marked a change in the sound and production style of The Kinks. He felt unsure of his skill in mixing and recording their records and later commented, \"I feel that I shouldn't have been allowed to produce Something Else.

It was produced by Nigel Godrich and released on 9 June 2003. It was the last album released under Radiohead's six-album record contract with Parlophone.\nAfter two Radiohead albums incorporating electronica, jazz and 20th-century classical music influences, Hail to the Thief was seen as a return to a more conventional rock sound while maintaining electronic and jazz elements. Following difficult recording sessions for previous albums, the band worked deliberately quickly, employing a live, \"spontaneous\" approach, and cited the Beatles, the Pixies, Charlie Mingus, Can, New Order, Tubeway Army and Siouxsie and the Banshees as influences. George Orwell, Dante, and fairy tales influenced the lyrics, much of which were written in response to the War on Terror. Songwriter and vocalist Thom Yorke said the album addresses \"frustration and powerlessness and anger, and the huge gap between the people that put themselves in control and the people that allegedly voted for them.\"\nHail to the Thief debuted at number</p>",

St. Anger was originally intended for release on June 10, 2003, but was released five days earlier due to concerns over unlicensed distribution through peer-to-peer file sharing networks. The album marks the final collaboration between Metallica and producer Bob Rock, whose relationship began with the band's fifth studio album, 1991's Metallica.\nSt. Anger is the first Metallica album since Master of Puppets that does not feature long-time bassist Jason Newsted. Newsted left the band prior to the initial sessions for the album, leaving Rock to temporarily take his place until a permanent replacement could be found. It is also the first album since ...And Justice for All to have a title track. Recording of the album initially started on April 24, 2001, but was postponed indefinitely when rhythm</p>",

Benitez remixed many of the tracks and produced \"Holiday\".

In mid-2003, the band began recording songs for an album titled Cigarettes and Valentines. But, the master tracks were stolen and the band decided to start recording a new album rather than re-record Cigarettes and Valentines.\nGreen Day decided to produce a rock opera, inspired by the work of The Who and several musicals. The album follows the life of Jesus of Suburbia, a character with \"anti-hero\" image created by Billie Joe Armstrong. Following early recording at Studio 880 in Oakland, California, the band finished the album at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood.\nThe album achieved success worldwide, charting in 27 countries and peaking at number one in 19 of them, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Since its release, American Idiot has sold over 14 million copies worldwide, over 6 million copies of which were in the United States alone, including 267,000 in its opening week. The album spawned five successful singles, including the international hits \"American</p>",

Elsewhere, there are tales of physical and mental abuse (\"None But My Own\", \"The Rage To Overcome\"), the condemning of profits from religious soliciting (\"Death Church\"), succumbing to substance abuse (\"I'm Your God Now\") and aforementioned themes of urban decay, social unrest, rebellion, belligerence, and socio-political commentary.\nStylistically, the album is credited as having bridged the gap between Pantera-style groove and the thrash metal stylings of Slayer's 80's output. Compared to their concurrent releases, it is probably their most raw and aggressive recording thus far, and the style is somewhat harkened back to on their post-Supercharger output.\nThe release of this album was followed shortly by numerous tours,</p>",

The album was recorded at Escape Studios, Kent, United Kingdom with additional recording and mixing at AIR Studios, London, and is the band's biggest selling album, having sold two million copies worldwide.\nAfter three albums with Deep Purple's Roger Glover producing, Manny Charlton stepped into that position, one he filled for several subsequent albums.\nIt was Nazareth's first big hit album (aside from the minor success of Razamanaz), including classics such as the title track, \"Love Hurts\" (on the US version, but not the Canadian/European, it replaced the original \"Guilty\"), \"Beggars Day\" and \"Please Don't Judas Me\".\nThe album title is often considered to be a shortened form of the phrase describing a folk hangover cure, \"the hair of the dog that bit you\". However, according to Dan McCafferty, the title is a play on \"heir of the dog\", i.e. a \"son of a bitch\". This was the title the band had intended for the album, but the label did not approve and had the name changed, although nearly a thousand album covers were printed. The original \"Heir of the Dog\" album covers are very rare</p>",

The protagonist of \"Baba\" goes on a spiritual pilgrimage to India where she encounters a guru who, like many spiritual teachers in India, is referred to as \"Baba\". The word \"Baba\" means \"father\" in the Hindi language. Morissette opened most of shows during the Junkie era with the song, and it was featured as an opener during her 2002 tours.

After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost in a studio in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added.\nA concept album, Red Headed Stranger is about a fugitive on the run from the law after killing his wife and her lover.

		"body" : "<p>Being There is the second album by Chicago-based rock band Wilco. Despite its release as a nineteen-song double album, Being There was sold at a single album price due to a deal between lead singer Jeff Tweedy and Reprise Records. Released on October 29, 1996, the album was an improvement for the band in both sales and critical reception as compared with their first album, A.M..\nTaking its name from the 1979 film Being There, the self-produced effort featured more surrealistic and introspective writing than their previous album. This was due in part to several significant changes in Tweedy's life, including the birth of his first child. Musically, it juxtaposed the alternative country styles songs reminiscent of Uncle Tupelo with psychedelic, surreal songs. It was the only Wilco album with steel guitarist Bob Egan and the last with multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston.\nJeff Tweedy formed Wilco in 1994 after creative differences between Jay Farrar and Tweedy caused the breakup of Uncle Tupelo. The band entered the recording studio almost immediately afterwards to record and release A.M. in 1995, which saw disappointing sales. Jay Farrar's new band Son Volt released Trace in late 1995</p>",

Initially, she began working with Mirwais Ahmadza&#239; and recorded two tracks for the album. Madonna felt that their collaboration was not going in the direction she desired. Madonna took her collaboration with Stuart Price who was overviewing her documentary I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Being tired of all the political diatribes she had included in her previous works, Madonna felt the need to relax and be in a happy mood. The album was mainly recorded at Price's home-studio where Madonna spent most of her time during the recordings.\nMusically the album is structured like a DJ's set. The songs are sequenced and blended together so that they are played continuously without any gaps. The title arrived from the fact that the tracklisting for the album consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning, and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics</p>",

The album is also the group's last to feature guitarist John Frusciante, who confirmed his departure from the band in 2009.\nThe album was critically praised for integrating musical styles from several aspects of the band's career. The album gained the band seven Grammy Award nominations in 2007 including an award for Best Rock Album and one for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package.

The album was named after a cover featured on the album \"Texas Flood,\" recorded by blues singer Larry Davis in 1958. Produced by the band and recording engineer Richard Mullen, it was recorded in only three days at Jackson Browne's personal recording studio in Los Angeles. Vaughan wrote six of the ten tracks on Texas Flood. Two singles were released from the album. A music video was made for \"Love Struck Baby\" and received regular rotation on MTV in 1983. In 1999, Texas Flood was reissued with five bonus tracks including an interview segment, studio outtake, and live performances.\nVaughan and Double Trouble had performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in July 1982 and caught the attention of musician Jackson Browne. He offered the band three days of free use in his Los Angeles recording studio. During Thanksgiving weekend, they accepted Browne's offer and recorded a demo. It was heard by record producer John H. Hammond, who had discovered artists such as Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, and Bruce Springsteen among many others. He presented the demo</p>",

Eyes Open is the 15th best-selling album of the 2000s in the UK.\nThe band's primary aim for a fourth album was to create a better one than the previous, Final Straw. They felt the need to become better players of their respective instruments as they thought they had \"barely [gotten] away\" with the success of the last album. Subsequently, keyboardist Tom Simpson and drummer Jonny Quinn took classical piano and drum lessons respectively, during the recording of the album.\nThe band visited Dingle, on Ireland's west coast and started writing new material. They stayed in a small house, described by Simpson as a \"little round house overlooking the sea\". They then did some recording in a studio. The main recording sessions, though, happened in an old \"condemned\" studio in Westmeath, located in the central part of the country. Simpson found the place to be \"laid-back\" and \"almost like a holiday home\".</p>",

Other criticism arose from the omission of some of the band's biggest songs like \"The Reflex\", \"Girls On Film\" and \"Rio\". However, Arena still managed to peak at #6 in the UK (24 November) and #4 in the US (1 December).\nThe album was eventually re-issued 1 June 2004 and included two bonus tracks</p>",

This album, as evidenced by its title, is a departure from hard rock to an electric blues style.\nStill Got the Blues has been arguably the most successful of Moore's solo albums as it was well received by old fans and also converted many who had never before heard of the Irish guitarist. The album's visibility and success was assisted by contributions from well known veterans Albert King, Albert Collins and George Harrison. Moore chose to record his lead vocal in the control room with the then just released Shure Beta 58 supercardiod microphone rather than the studio typical big phantom powered condensor microphone in a sound booth. It is argued that this assisted him to achieve as greater passion and live feel whilst still maintaining studio polish.\nThe title track was released on the single format and reached #97 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 16 February 1991.

While Jagger released the tepidly received Primitive Cool in 1987, Richards recorded Talk Is Cheap, his solo debut, which would be released in 1988 to rave reviews. The two years largely apart appeared to have healed the wounds sufficiently to begin resurrecting their partnership and their band.\nMeeting in January 1989, just preceding the Stones' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the chemistry between Jagger and Richards easily outshone whatever differences they had and after composing some 50 songs in a matter of weeks,</p>",

		"body" : "<p>Live! in Europe is an album released by Irish Blues guitarist Rory Gallagher in 1972. As the title suggests, it is a series of live recordings made by Gallagher during his European tour.\nLive in Europe is considered by many critics to be a landmark live recording, as it carefully blends the musicians with the crowd to create a gig-like atmosphere so craved by those who enjoy or produce live albums. Gallagher always insisted that his studio albums failed to capture the raw energy of his live acts and as a result released a number of live albums, many of which contain what are considered the \"definitive versions\" of some of his better known songs. Bob Dylan requested to record the song I Could've Had Religion that features on this album with Gallagher, but this recording never happened.\nLive In Europe broke into the Top 10 of the UK albums chart, consolidating the success of his first two studio offerings. Rory's high-octane blues-rock was well suited for the stage, a fact to which anyone who saw him in concert or has heard this or other live albums like Irish Tour '74 and Stage Struck can attest. The set kicks off with two rockers, Junior Wells' \"Messin' With the Kid\" and the</p>",

According to Petty, \"He left right after the session without really saying goodbye\". Steve Ferrone plays drums on Wildflowers and would join the band officially the following year. However, the album was not credited to the Heartbreakers because, in Petty's words, \"Rick (Rubin) and I both wanted more freedom than to be strapped into five guys.\" Freedom notwithstanding, Petty chose to use most of his regular band as session players, demonstrating his comfort with that format.

Roger Waters, once the lead singer of Pink Floyd, was sufficiently inspired by a book of mine to produce a CD called Amused to Death. This fact so elevated my prestige among undergraduates that I am hardly in a position to repudiate him or his kind of music.\"\nWaters stated in an interview with Rockline on 8 February 1993 that he wanted to use samples of HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey on the album. Stanley Kubrick, the director, turned him down on the basis that it would open the door to many other people using the sound sample.

The songwriting on In Rainbows was more personal than other Radiohead albums, with singer Thom Yorke describing most tracks as his versions of \"seduction songs\". Radiohead incorporated a wide variety of musical styles and instruments, using not only electronic music and string arrangements, but also pianos, celestes, and the ondes Martenot.\nUpon its retail release, In Rainbows entered the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200 at number one; by October 2008, it had sold more than three million copies</p>",

In 2003, it was placed at number 385 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\nSteely Dan was still considered a true &#8220;group&#8221; at the time this, their third album, was released; in addition to core members Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, guitarists Jeff &#8220;Skunk&#8221; Baxter and Denny Dias and drummer Jim Hodder (as well as multi-instrumentalist Victor Feldman) had appeared on both previous Steely Dan releases along with a host of session aces; all five appeared on the inside cover of the album, though Hodder was replaced on drums by Jim Gordon and Jeff Porcaro for the recordings</p>",

This commercial success came after the band had released three experimental and purely instrumental albums. The single was believed to be Vertigo Records' only ever international hit.\nAutobahn is not a completely electronic album, as violin, flute, and guitar are used along with synthesizers. The title track features both untreated and vocoded vocals; the remaining tracks are purely instrumental. Kraftwerk used a Minimoog, an ARP Odyssey, an EMS Synthi AKS and various devices of their own design and implementation, such as their famous electronic drums.\nThe title track is intended to capture the feeling of driving on the Autobahn: from travelling through the landscape, the high-speed concentration on the fast lane, to tuning the car radio and the monotony of a long trip. It describes the A 555 from K&#246;ln to Bonn&#8212;the first Autobahn ever. It was</p>",

This, combined with their ever increasing touring schedule, made EMI realise that no new product would be released for some time, possibly not until well over a year after completing their previous album, Atom Heart Mother.

It was released by Fiction Records on 17 March 2008 in the United Kingdom and was released by Geffen Records on 22 April 2008 in the United States. The album debuted at number five on the UK Albums Chart and won the Mercury Prize in 2008.\r\nThe album was recorded at Blueprint Studios in Manchester, and is the first Elbow album to be entirely self-produced, mixed and recorded without any outside help. The bulk of the record was written and performed by the band, aside from a guest appearance from singer-songwriter Richard Hawley, who contributes guest vocals, lead guitar and co-songwriting on \"The Fix\". The Seldom Seen Kid also incorporated dynamic range and made note of this in its packaging, by promoting Turn Me Up! in the album's packaging.\r\nThe title of the album is taken from one of the characters who appears in US author Damon Runyon's humorous, idiosyncratic tales of gangster life on New York's Broadway in the 1920s. In addition to appearing as a lyric within the album's first single, \"Grounds for Divorce\", The Seldom Seen Kid is also a nickname, given by Guy Garvey's father, to Bryan Glancy, a</p>",

		"body" : "<p>Journey's ninth studio album (tenth overall), Raised on Radio, was released in May 1986 on the Columbia Records label.\nFollowing their two most successful albums, lead singer Steve Perry began to take more control over the band's direction. First, Ross Valory and Steve Smith were fired from the band, against the wishes of manager Herbie Herbert. The two were replaced by various studio musicians for the recording of Raised on Radio, including Randy Jackson (bass guitar) and Larrie Londin (drums). Smith did record three tracks with Journey on the album, and he and Valory still received revenues from the record and subsequent tour. Both returned to Journey in 1996.\nSecond, Perry changed the original title of this project from Freedom to Raised on Radio. This drew the ire of Herbert and some of the band members, and might have contributed to the departure of Smith and Valory.\nMuch of the album has a feel similar to Perry's solo album Street Talk. However, the classic Journey sound can still be heard on songs like \"Girl Can't Help It\" and the longtime concert staple \"Be Good to Yourself.\" The songs \"Why Can't This Night Go on Forever,\" in a similar style to that of \"Faithfully;\"</p>",

The album itself hit #5 on the Billboard charts. A US and European tour followed which resulted in an audience riot in Germany after the band decided not to play without Grace Slick who was ill. They lost all their guitars and equipment during the riot and played one more tense show on German TV in Hamburg after which Grace left the band for one album. Marty Balin fronted the band for one more show at a Genesis concert at the Knebworth Festival in England using rented equipment. When they returned to the USA drummer John Barbataleft the band after a serious car accident. This would be the end of the 1970's line-up and several new members joined the band, as well as a new record producer.

It has sold more than 3 million copies worldwide, with over 585,000 in the United States as of September 2010.\nThe album was officially announced, along with a track listing, on November 17, 2008. The album first began selling in Germany and Ireland, on January 23.\nThe album came out of songwriting and recording that Springsteen continued with towards the close of his previous work, 2007's Magic, as the band worked on a video for one of that album's songs. \"What Love Can Do\" was written, in Springsteen's words, as a \"love in the time of Bush\" meditation, but felt like the start of something new rather than a candidate for Magic. Encouraged by his 2000s producer Brendan O'Brien, Springsteen decided to start work on a new album and wrote \"This Life,\" \"My Lucky Day,\" \"Life Itself,\" \"Good Eye,\" and \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" during the next week. They were then recorded with the E Street Band members during breaks on their 2007&#8211;2008 Magic Tour, with most being finished in just a few takes. This all reflected a faster pace of producing new music than Springsteen had been</p>",

Pinder had just started a new family in California, and found that he was not getting along with his bandmates as he had. As a result of Pinder's departure, Justin Hayward and John Lodge were forced to play some of the remaining keyboard parts themselves, and Pinder would be replaced by former Yes keyboardist Patrick Moraz in time for their 1979 tour, beginning a new era in the band's history.\nOctave was considered a departure from previous Moody Blues albums, mainly because the group's use of lounge-style organs and synthesisers in place of a Mellotron or Chamberlin (Pinder's song \"One Step Into the Light\" referenced the Mellotron).

The production of the album was often halted by the lack of confidence that producers had in West's rapping ability, eventually being convinced based off the success of his early musical ventures.\nThe album had production entirely handled by West, and features musical contributions from Jay-Z, John Legend, Ervin \"EP\" Pope, Miri Ben-Ari, and Syleena Johnson. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West's lyrics on the album concern themes of family, religion, self-consciousness, materialism, and personal struggles. The album was promoted by singles including \"Through the Wire\" and \"Jesus Walks\", both of which received critical acclaim. \"All Falls Down\" and \"Slow Jamz\" both charted within the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, with the latter charting at position one.\nThe album debuted at number two on the US Billboard</p>",

Some of the songs had been first released on Pandora's Box's 1989 album, Original Sin.\nThe album was released by Virgin Records outside of North America, where it was released by MCA. The third part of the Bat trilogy, Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster is Loose, was released in 2006.\nJust like the first album of the trilogy, Bat Out Of Hell II, was a huge commercial success and sold over 20 million copies worldwide.\nIn the midst of the success of Bat Out of Hell, desperate for a follow-up, management and the record company put pressure on Steinman to stop touring in order to</p>",

As frontman Dave Grohl wanted a record that would capture the essence of the band's earlier work and lack the artificiality of digital recording, the group recorded in Grohl's garage in Encino, California with only analog equipment. The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's Nevermind. Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques. The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments in the previous albums, and most of the lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future. Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, and Fee Waybill.\nThe recording sessions were documented for fans on the band's website and Twitter, and the album's promotion included the documentary Back and Forth and a worldwide concert tour that included concerts played in fans' garages.

Following a hiatus from his music career, West worked on the album through a communal development that involved him and various other musicians and producers contributing collectively to its music. Recording sessions for the album took place primarily at Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii during 2009 to 2010. Production was handled by West and several other record producers, including Jeff Bhasker, RZA, No I.D., and Mike Dean, among others.\nNoted by music writers for its varied elements, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates musical components from West's previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic elements. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, with transparent lyrics expressing emotional extremes, ego, uncertainty, and references to drinking and drug use. Its subject matter also explores consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.\nThe album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 496,000 copies in its first week.

The heavy airplay eventually led to the duo's first Number One hit in four years, the Voices release, \"Kiss on My List\" in early 1981.\nAs the liner notes to the 2004 Private Eyes reissue indicate, it was while Daryl Hall and John Oates were recording the follow-up album in their adopted hometown of New York City, during the spring of 1981, that \"Kiss On My List\" went to Number One</p>",

After the success of the Bee Gees in 1977/1978 there was some time to perform songwriting for other artists and Barbra Streisand asked Barry Gibb to write an album for her. It became her best-selling album to date with sales (according to an official press release) of over 12 million copies and was produced by the Bee Gees' Barry Gibb and the Bee Gees' regular production team of Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson.\nThe title track, a duet between Streisand and Gibb, won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1981, and was a #3 Billboard Hot 100 hit. The first single \"Woman in Love\" became one of the most successful songs of Streisand's music career and spent a total of three weeks at the #1 position in the Billboard chart. \"What Kind of Fool\", another duet with Gibb, reached #10. The fourth single, \"Promises\", a more disco-oriented track released in May 1981, reached as high as #48. This song was also released on Streisand's first commercially released 12\" disco single as a solo artist following her 1979 duet with Donna Summer and two \"promotional\" 12\" singles released for \"Shake Me, Wake Me</p>",

However, the project was put on hiatus due to the recording of Destiny&#39;s Child&#39;s final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled (2004), and her starring role in the film Dreamgirls (2006). While on vacation after filming Dreamgirls, Knowles began contacting various producers; she rented Sony Music Studios, and completed B&#39;Day in three weeks. Most of the lyrical content of the album was inspired by Knowles&#39; role in the film. The album&#39;s musical style ranges from 1970s&ndash;80s funk influences and balladry to urban contemporary elements such as hip hop and R&amp;B. Live instrumentation was employed in recording most of the tracks as part of Knowles&#39; vision of creating a record using live instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon its release, B&#39;Day received generally positive reviews from most music critics and has since earned Knowles several accolades, including the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album at the 2007 Grammy Awards.

		"body" : "<p>Tracy Chapman is the self-titled debut album by singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, released on April 5, 1988, by Elektra Records. The album was recorded at the Powertrax studio in Hollywood, California. In 1987, Chapman was discovered by fellow Tufts University student Brian Koppelman. He offered to show her talent to his father, who owned a successful publishing company, however she did not consider. However, after multiple performances, Koppelman found a demo tape of her singing her single &quot;Talkin&#39; Bout a Revolution&quot;, where he took it to radio stations, and was eventually signed to Elektra Records. Through the production of the album, many producers turned down Chapman as they did not favor her musical direction. However, David Kershenbaum wanted to produce the studio album and songs, as he has always wanted to record acoustic music. The album was recorded all in Hollywood, California within only eight weeks of recording. Most of the writing is based on political and social causes. Tracy Chapman was critically acclaimed from basically all music critics, praising the simplicity, Chapman&#39;s vocal ability and the lyrical content. Critics also noted that because of Chapman&#39;s recording and writing back in the 80&#39;s era, critics said it has benefited off other mainstream artists. They also noticed the political and social lyrical content. Tracy Chapman received commercial success in most countries it charted in. The album peaked in the top spot in countries including Austria, New Zealand, Switzerland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The album also peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200, and was certified 6x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, with sales exceeding over six million copies in the United States alone.</p>\r\n",

Recorded a year before the Ruby sessions, Doughty and bass player Sebastian Steinberg recorded the tune at the avant-garde jazz club The Knitting Factory during the daytime, when the club was closed, with club soundperson James McLean.

It is their first album produced by O&#39;Neill, who was assigned to the band after the tour in support of Fight for the Rock. This album shows the beginning of Savatage&#39;s exploration of progressive metal, in their search for new forms of musical expression. Many fans consider this album the original turning point in their musical identity, distinguishing between the old and new Savatage. It is not a concept album, but it has a constant tone and is more complex than their previous albums, with two entirely instrumental tracks that go beyond simple guitar riffs and solos, namely &quot;Prelude to Madness&quot; and &quot;Last Dawn&quot;. Through Paul O&#39;Neill&#39;s connections, he brought in Ray Gillen of Badlands fame to perform a vocal duet at the end of &quot;Strange Wings&quot;. &quot;Prelude to Madness&quot; is an arrangement of Grieg&#39;s &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; from the Peer Gynt suite. Oddly, Grieg is not credited for this song, but for the following title track - which ironically, is an original song. The intro of &quot;Prelude to Madness&quot; features keyboards and guitar playing &quot;Mars, the Bringer of War&quot; from Gustav Holst&#39;s suite, The Planets.</p>\r\n",

The original drum and bass tracks were replaced with recordings by Osbourne&#39;s then-current bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin, as a management response to legal action by original bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake for unpaid royalty fees.

When questioned about it, Arab Strap&#39;s leader/singer, Aiden, said &quot;They have a sense of humor.&quot; Malcolm, the band&#39;s instrumentalist, added, &quot;Because Arab Strap is quite an interesting name. The words go well together. That&#39;s why we chose it as a band name. We&#39;re friends with them, but there&#39;s a limit to putting someone else&#39;s name on an album. They&rsquo;re taking away something from us.&quot; He also mentioned that the album had been confused as a collaboration between the bands. The album features several lead vocals by members of the band other than Stuart Murdoch. Stevie Jackson sings lead on both &quot;Seymour Stein&quot; and &quot;Chickfactor&quot;, Stuart David gives a spoken word performance on &quot;A Space Boy Dream&quot; and Isobel Campbell sings lead on &quot;Is It Wicked Not to Care?&quot;.

On tour, Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker, who would stay with the band permanently. With sales continuing 19 years after its release, Stranger Than Fiction is one of Bad Religion&#39;s most successful albums, featuring two of their well-known hit singles, &quot;Infected&quot; and the re-recorded version of &quot;21st Century&quot;, which both earned airplay on MTV and radio stations, such as KROQ. The album included one more hit single, &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, though the last one, &quot;Incomplete&quot;, failed to make any national chart. As of today, Stranger Than Fiction remains the only Bad Religion record to obtain gold status in the United States and Canada. The album was re-released by Epitaph Records on September 15, 2008. In 2009, Rhino Records released a colored vinyl to coincide with this album&#39;s 15th anniversary.</p>\r\n",

In 2012, in recognition of the album&#39;s 20th anniversary, Megadeth kicked off a 20th anniversary tour in South America, playing the album in its entirety.

The album was a continuation of the band&#39;s 1990s reinvention, as they pursued a new musical direction by combining alternative rock, techno, dance, and electronica influences. The album employs a variety of production techniques relatively new to U2, including sampling, loops, programmed drum machines, and sequencing. Recording sessions began in 1995 with various record producers, including Nellee Hooper, Flood, Howie B, and Steve Osborne, who were introducing the band to various electronica influences. At the time, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. was inactive due to a back injury, prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting. Upon Mullen&#39;s return, the band began re-working much of their material but ultimately struggled to complete songs. After the band allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their upcoming 1997 PopMart Tour before the album was completed, U2 were rushed into completing the album. Even after delaying the album&#39;s release date from the 1996 Christmas and holiday season to March 1997, U2 ran out of time in the studio and the final product was not to their liking. Since the album&#39;s release, many of its songs have been re-recorded and remixed.</p>\r\n",

Following this, a recording of the piece was released by ECM New Series. A recording of the opening sections is on Steve Reich&#39;s official website. In his introduction to the score, Reich mentions that although the piece is named Music for 18 Musicians, it is not necessarily advisable to perform the piece with that few players due to the extensive doubling it requires. With only 18 musicians, the parts are divided as follows: ⁕violin ⁕cello ⁕female voice ⁕female voice ⁕female voice ⁕piano ⁕piano ⁕piano and maracas ⁕marimba and maracas ⁕marimba and xylophone ⁕marimba and xylophone ⁕marimba and xylophone ⁕metallophone and piano ⁕piano and marimba ⁕marimba, xylophone, and piano ⁕clarinet and bass clarinet ⁕clarinet and bass clarinet ⁕female voice and piano The piece is based around a cycle of eleven chords. A small piece of music is based around each chord, and the piece returns to the original cycle at the end. The sections are aptly named &quot;Pulses&quot;, and Section I-XI. This was Reich&#39;s first attempt at writing for larger ensembles, and the extension of performers resulted in a growth of psycho-acoustic effects, which fascinated Reich, and he noted that he would like to &quot;explore this idea further&quot;. A prominent factor in this work is the augmentation of the harmonies and melodies and the way that they develop this piece. Another important factor in the piece is the use of human breath, used in the clarinets and voices, which help structure and bring a pulse to the piece. The player plays the pulsing note for as long as he can hold it, while each chord is melodically deconstructed by the ensemble, along with augmentation of the notes held. The metallophone, is used to cue the ensemble to change patterns or sections.</p>\r\n",

Recorded in an attic, Stromae expressed his desire to incorporate Caribbean and African musical influences along with his signature 1990&#39;s-inspired dance beats. The album explores themes as diverse as alienation from social networks, relationship issues, discrimination, cigarettes and lung cancer, AIDS and absent father figures. Prior to its official release and afterwards, Racine Carr&eacute;e has immediately received critical acclaim for its thoughtful lyrics and gained comparisons to fellow Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel. The album has also been a commercial success across Western Europe, including non-francophone countries. Racine Carr&eacute;e has topped the charts in France, Flanders, Wallonia, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Italy, as well as reaching the top ten in Canada, and the top forty in Germany. In his native Belgium, it has remained at the top the charts for multiple weeks and been certified eight times platinum by the BEA. In France, the album has been certified diamond by the SNEP and become one of the highest-selling albums in recent years after amassing over one million copies sold four months after its release. Racine Carr&eacute;e has so far yielded three chart-topping singles: &quot;Papaoutai&quot;, &quot;Formidable&quot; and &quot;Tous les m&ecirc;mes&quot;.</p>\r\n",

It was released by the duo&#39;s imprint Daft Life, under exclusive license to Columbia Records, on 17 May 2013. The album pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 1980s era of music in the United States, particularly the sounds that emerged from Los Angeles. This tribute was reflected in the gradual promotional rollout for the album that included billboards, television advertisements, and a web series. Unlike their previous studio albums, Daft Punk recruited session musicians to perform live instrumentation in professional recording locations, and limited the use of electronic instruments to drum machines, a custom-built modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders. The album features collaborations with Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams, and Pharrell Williams. Random Access Memories is Daft Punk&#39;s most critically successful album, scoring 87/100 on Metacritic. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014, it won Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, and the single &quot;Get Lucky&quot; won for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.

		"body" : "<p>Solid Air is a folk jazz album released in 1973 by John Martyn on Island Records. Contemporary reviews were favourable with music paper Sounds declaring that Solid Air flows beautifully and shows the entire spectrum of music that John Martyn has at his fingertips.&quot; The album has continued to receive acclaim and is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die by Robert Dimery. The album was rated as the 67th Greatest British Album Ever by the British music magazine Q, and was also included in their list of Best Chill-Out Albums Of All Time. &quot;Solid Air&quot;, the title track, was dedicated to a friend of Martyn&#39;s, Nick Drake. Drake died of an antidepressant overdose 18 months after the album was released. Martyn said of the track &quot;It was done for a friend of mine, and it was done right with very clear motives, and I&#39;m very pleased with it, for varying reasons. It has got a very simple message, but you&#39;ll have to work that one out for yourself.&quot; &quot;May You Never&quot; became something of a signature song for Martyn, becoming a staple of his live performances. Released in November 1971 as a single in an early form, the song was re-recorded during the Solid Air sessions.</p>\r\n",

The album has received much critical acclaim since its release and has been cited as an influence by various artists. Several artists have played cover versions of songs from Ege Bamyası.

It serves as the follow-up to Bieber&#39;s third studio album Believe (2012), and it was developed after the release of his collection Journals (2013), which saw him in a more R&amp;B direction. Working on the album over a period of almost two years, Bieber struggled to find a musical direction for the record and scrapped it many times. With the help of personal friend and frequent collaborator Jason Boyd, Bieber started to write and record with the idea of making an inspirational album that could encourage people through uplifting messages during a period of media scrutiny and his involvement in various misdemeanours as well as his tumultuous relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After working with producer Skrillex, who along with partner Diplo in their project Jack &Uuml; released the top 10 single &quot;Where Are &Uuml; Now&quot; (2015), featuring Bieber&#39;s vocals, Bieber found the record&#39;s sonic direction and worked with Skrillex on a handful of the album&#39;s songs. Purpose was described as a mix of dance-pop, EDM music and R&amp;B, as well as including influences of tropical house in some tracks and live instruments such as acoustic guitars in some others, while lyrically addressing subjects such as apologies and faith. The album received generally favorable reviews from most critics, who praised the consistent sound, noted his artistic growth and deemed it to be his best album to date. Other critics, however, criticized its lyrical content, noted that the album focused excessively on his requests for apologies, and found him tiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpose_(Justin_Bieber_album)\" target=\"_blank\">Read more on Wikipedia</a></p>\r\n",

		"body" : "<p>Currents&nbsp;is the third studio album by Australian&nbsp;psychedelic rock&nbsp;act&nbsp;Tame Impala, released on 17 July 2015 on&nbsp;Interscope Records. Like the group&#39;s previous two albums,&nbsp;Currentswas written, recorded, performed, and produced by primary member&nbsp;Kevin Parker. For the first time, Parker also&nbsp;mixed&nbsp;the music. It was also the first time that Parker recorded all instruments by himself; the album featured no other collaborations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After releasing the group&#39;s previous record,&nbsp;Lonerism&nbsp;(2012), Parker began work on&nbsp;Currents, largely recording at his home studio in&nbsp;Fremantle. He engrossed himself with writing and recording, and in keeping with his reputation as a musical auteur, labored over the details of each song, ultimately causing the release date to be delayed by two months. In contrast to the psychedelic rock sound of the project&#39;s prior work,&nbsp;Currents&nbsp;marks a shift to more&nbsp;dance-oriented music, with more emphasis placed on synthesizers than guitars. Parker was inspired to seek a change out of desire to hear Tame Impala&#39;s music played in dance clubs and a more communal setting. Thematically, the record is about the process of personal transformation, which many critics interpreted to be the result of a romantic break-up. The album&#39;s cover art depicting&nbsp;vortex shedding&nbsp;is a visualization of these themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currents_(Tame_Impala_album)\" target=\"_blank\">Read more on Wikipedia</a></p>\r\n",
