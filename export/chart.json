The list was compiled by Paul Gambaccini in 1978.<br />\r\n<em>&quot;In my years with &#39;Rolling Stone&#39; and BBC Radio 1 I&#39;ve become aware of how seriously consumers weigh the opinions of rock critics before purchasing LPs. I polled the English-speaking world&#39;s leading critics and compiled this book. The list should be a definitive buyer&#39;s guide to rock LPs, and the photographs and top tens of each critic in the second section of the book should prove an irresistible treat for rock fans. After all, we are voyeuristic about our leading writers as any interest group.&quot;</em> <strong>Paul Gambaccini</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nDownload the PDF for the complete list."

Quote from Absolute Radio:&nbsp;&quot;Here at Absolute Radio we know that you, our listeners, love your music. That&#39;s why we got you to vote in our poll of the Best Albums of All Time. And blimey, you guys put together a stunning top 100 albums! Adele&#39;s second offering 21 just scraped into the top 50, despite surpassing album sales of Pink Floyd&#39;s Dark Side Of The Moon in little over a year. The 1973 Pink Floyd classic was voted by you to be your favourite album of all time! The &#39;Someone Like You,&#39; singer has sold an astonishing 4.14 million copies in the UK, overtaking Pink Floyd&#39;s 4.11 million to date, yet it only ranked at number 45 in the survey, which also saw the Stone Roses make the top 5 in the year of their big reunion. Absolute Radio&#39;s new presenter Andy Bush revealed The Top 100 albums on Easter Sunday and Easter Monday 2012. He says &#39;There&rsquo;s no doubt Adele has enjoyed huge success with 21, and it&#39;s great for British music, but perhaps it just goes to show, it still has a long way to go before it can claim true &#39;classic&#39; status among music lovers.&#39; &quot;</p>\r\n"

We chose studio albums only - no soundtracks, live shows or compilations.&nbsp;Over 100,000 people voted, and on 1st April 2013, we counted down the results of your votes all day before Jo Whiley announced the winner in a special Easter show.&quot;</p>\r\n"
