Simon wrote most of the pair's songs, including three that reached number one on the US singles charts: \"The Sound of Silence\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\". In 1970, at the height of their popularity, the duo split, and Simon began a successful solo career, recording three highly-acclaimed albums over the next five years. In 1986, he released Graceland, an album inspired by South African township music that helped fuel the anti-apartheid movement. Besides music, Simon wrote and starred in the film One-Trick Pony in 1980 and co-wrote the Broadway musical The Capeman in 1998.\nThrough his solo and collaborative work, Simon has earned 13 Grammys, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2006 was selected as one of the \"100 People Who Shaped the World\" by Time magazine.

After initial success in Europe with his group The Jimi Hendrix Experience, he achieved fame in the United States following his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, Hendrix headlined the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. He often favored raw overdriven amplifiers with high gain and treble and helped develop the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback. Hendrix, as well as his friend Eric Clapton, popularized use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock which he often used to deliver an exaggerated pitch in his solos, particularly with high bends, complex guitar playing, and use of legato. As a record producer, Hendrix also broke new ground in using the recording studio as an extension of his musical ideas.

He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 34 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll’s greatest songwriters and performers\". He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997. Young's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature alto or high tenor singing voice.

After Morrison's death in 1971, the remaining members continued as a trio until finally disbanding in 1973.\nThey were signed to Elektra Records in 1966, and released a string of multi-platinum albums, beginning with their 1967 eponymous debut album, followed by their 1967 album Strange Days. In 1968, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Waiting for the Sun. The 1967 release of The Doors was the first in a series of top ten albums in the US, followed by Strange Days (1967), Waiting for the Sun (1968), The Soft Parade (1969), Morrison Hotel (1970), Absolutely Live (1970) and L.A.

In 1996, they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record his second album in New York with Tom Verlaine as producer. In 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album, to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk, recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue.

During the early 1980s, the band's increasingly dark and tormented music helped form the gothic rock genre.\nAfter the release of Pornography (1982), the band's future was uncertain and Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired. With the 1982 single \"Let's Go to Bed\" Smith began to place a pop sensibility into the band's music (as well as a unique stage look).

Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the United Kingdom, as they preferred to establish the concept of album-orientated rock. Their first two albums, with their heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound, led to Led Zeppelin being regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, even though the band's individualistic style drew from varied sources and transcends any single music genre. Their next two albums incorporated wider musical influences, particularly from folk music; the fourth, untitled album, which featured the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the</p>",

He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for over five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs, such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\", became anthems for the US civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving his initial base in the culture of folk music behind, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" has been described as radically altering the parameters of popular music in 1965. His recordings employing electric instruments attracted denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.\nDylan's lyrics incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the songs of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, and the music and performance styles of Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Elvis Presley,</p>",

Bowie&#39;s impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, &quot;challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day&quot; and &quot;created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.&quot; The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.",

The seventh child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5, then the Jacksons in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971.\r\nIn the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. The music videos for his songs, including those of \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\", were credited with transforming the medium into an art form and a promotional tool, and the popularity of these videos helped to bring the relatively new television channel MTV to fame. Videos such as \"Black or White\" and \"Scream\" made him a staple on MTV in the 1990s. Through stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a number of dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to</p>",

The track made it to Cafe del Mar (chillhouse-mix) and was licensed on their label. One year later they worked with Mario Vitalino Dos Santos on various tracks. Mario lives in Belgium but was born in Salvador, Brazil. There fans often sing various songs at gigs, such as, We love the Arsenal we do, Who's that team we call the Arsenal, Ooh to be a gooner and We all follow the Arsenal, over land and sea. In the studio they are joined by Steve Verhaege, Bruno Fevery, Bart Van Aken, Mirko Banovic, Mario Goossens and Leonie Gysel. Like all Brazilians living elsewhere, he pours his lament into bossa-type complaints. Hendrik and John try to translate those sentiments into Arsenal songs and in each one you can hear \"saudade\". The first EP to appear out of that collaboration (\"A Volta\") was a direct hit. Loved by the critics and played by all the major dj's this track made it to several big compilations.

Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into this mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums and vocals.\nAfter Audioslave released three successful albums, received three Grammy nominations, and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba, Cornell issued a statement in February 2007 announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as</p>",

The band's leader, composer, arranger and producer, Brian Wilson, was responsible for writing most of the band's early singles and albums.

These songs and their accompanying albums were internationally popular, making the Beach Boys one of the biggest acts of their time. The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its close vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a Southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance.

Influences upon the band's music included David Bowie, Roxy Music, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Van der Graaf Generator and Frank Zappa. The band's sound emerged as a mixture of glam rock, prog rock and straightforward rock and roll.

In 1985 Pezzati was replaced by Dave Riley, who played on Big Black's two full-length studio albums, Atomizer (1986) and Songs About Fucking (1987).\nBig Black's aggressive and abrasive music was characterized by distinctively clanky guitars and the use of a drum machine rather than a drum kit, elements which precursored industrial rock. The band acknowledged no taboos, and Albini's lyrics openly dealt with loaded topics including murder, rape, child sexual abuse, arson, racism, and misogyny. They also held staunch principles, shunning the mainstream music industry and insisting on complete control over all aspects of their career. Big Black booked their own tours, paid for their own recordings, and refused to sign contracts, eschewing many of the traditional corporate trappings of rock bands. In doing so they had a significant impact on the aesthetic development of independent and underground rock music.\nIn addition to two studio</p>",

In its first era, the band's musical style drew on the work of British Invasion groups including The Beatles and The Kinks, as well as The Byrds, The Beach Boys, and other US acts. To the resulting power pop, Big Star added dark, nihilistic themes, and produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a \"seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations\" in the words of Rolling Stone, as the \"quintessential American power pop band\" and \"one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock &amp; roll\".\nBig Star's first album&#8212;1972's #1 Record&#8212;was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records and limited distribution stunted its commercial success.

These themes were explored further when Henry Rollins joined the band as lead singer in 1981. Most of the band's material was released on Ginn's independent label, SST Records.\nOver the course of the 1980s, Black Flag's sound, as well as their notoriety, evolved in ways that both embraced and alienated much of their early audience.

Their first two albums contained strong elements of these genres, and although successful in the United Kingdom and Australia, Blondie was regarded as an underground band in the United States until the release of Parallel Lines in 1978. Over the next three years, the band achieved several hit singles and became noted for its eclectic mix of musical styles incorporating elements of disco, pop, rap, and reggae, while retaining a basic style as a New Wave band.\nBlondie broke up after the release of their sixth studio album The Hunter in 1982. Deborah Harry continued to pursue a solo career with varied results after taking a few years off to care for partner Chris Stein, who was diagnosed with pemphigus, a rare autoimmune disease of the skin.\nThe band reformed in 1997, achieving renewed success and a number one single in the United Kingdom with \"Maria\" in 1999. The group toured and performed throughout the world during the following years, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Blondie</p>",

What the band is most known for, from its start, is the fusing of rock, blues, pop music, horn arrangements, and jazz improvisation into a hybrid that came to be known as \"jazz-rock\". Unlike \"jazz fusion\" bands, which tend toward virtuostic displays of instrumental facility and some experimentation with electric instruments, the songs of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears merged the stylings of rock, pop and R&amp;B/soul music with big band, while also adding elements of 20th Century Classical and small combo jazz traditions.\nAl Kooper, Jim Fielder, Fred Lipsius, Randy Brecker, Jerry Weiss, Dick Halligan, Steve Katz, Howard Levy, and Bobby Colomby formed the original band. The creation of the group was inspired by the \"brass-rock\" ideas of The Buckinghams and its producer, James William Guercio, as well as the early 1960s Roulette-era Maynard Ferguson Orchestra (according to Kooper's autobiography).\n\"Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears\" was the name</p>",

Bragg was educated at Barking Abbey Secondary School in Barking.\nIn 1977, Bragg formed the punk rock/pub rock band Riff Raff, and toured London's pubs and clubs. The band released a series of singles, which did not receive wide exposure. He also worked in Guy Norris Records in Barking. Bragg became disillusioned with his music career, and in May 1981 joined the British Army as a recruit destined for the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars of the Royal Armoured Corps. After three months, he bought his way out of the army for &#163;175 and returned home, having attended basic training but having never served in a regiment as a soldier.\nBragg began performing frequent concerts and busking around London,</p>",

His music blended rock, blues and psychedelia with avant-garde and contemporary experimental composition. Beefheart was also known for exercising an almost dictatorial control over his supporting musicians, and for often constructing myths about his life.\nDuring his teen years in Lancaster, California, Van Vliet developed an eclectic musical taste and formed \"a mutually useful but volatile\" friendship with Frank Zappa, with whom he sporadically competed and collaborated. He began performing with his Captain Beefheart persona in 1964 and joined the original Magic Band line-up, initiated by Alexis Snouffer, in 1965.

The song was sent as a mix tape to a local DJ in the Boston area, who played the song in heavy rotation.

Originating in Manchester in 1991, along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, and fellow acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture.\nEd Simons was born in Herne Hill, South London on 9 June 1970 to a barrister mother and a father who was not around much when Simons was growing up. Simons' two main interests when he was young were aeroplanes and musicals. Simons attended two South London public schools, Alleyn's School and Dulwich College. During his school years, he developed a fondness for rare groove and Hip hop music, having frequented a club called The Mud Club from the age of 14. By the time he left school, his two main musical interests were two Manchester bands, New Order and The Smiths. After finishing school with 11 O levels and three A-levels, he continued on to study history, especially late medieval history, at the University of Manchester.\nTom Rowlands, a childhood classmate of Simons', was born on 11 January 1971 in Kingston upon Thames, London. When Rowlands was very young, his family relocated to Henley-on-Thames.</p>",

His album Sound Grammar received the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for music.\nColeman was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, where he began performing R&amp;B and bebop initially on tenor saxophone. Seeking a way to work his way out of his home town, he took a job in 1949 with a Silas Green from New Orleans traveling show and then with touring rhythm and blues shows. After a show in Baton Rouge, he was assaulted and his saxophone was destroyed.\nHe switched to alto, which has remained his primary instrument, first playing it in New Orleans after the Baton Rouge incident. He then joined the band of Pee Wee Crayton and travelled with them to Los Angeles.

		"body" : "Faith No More is an American rock band from San Francisco, California. Faith No More was originally formed as Faith No Man in 1981 by bassist Billy Gould, keyboardist Wade Worthington, vocalist Mike Morris, and drummer Mike Bordin. A year later Worthington was replaced by keyboardist Roddy Bottum, who along with Gould and Bordin, formed Faith No More. After going through a series of singers which included Courtney Love, Chuck Mosley joined the band in 1983. The same year, Jim Martin was recruited to replace guitarist Mark Bowen. That lineup released the band&#39;s first album, We Care a Lot, in 1985. Within a year, the band signed up with Slash Records, and in 1987 their second album Introduce Yourself was released. Membership remained stable until vocalist Mosley was replaced by Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton in 1988. In 1989, the band released their successful album The Real Thing, which featured their breakthrough hit single &quot;Epic&quot;. The band&#39;s next album Angel Dust, was also successful and spawned the hit &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot;, which became their sole No. 1 hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in their career. Angel Dust is widely considered to be one of the most influential albums of the &#39;90s. Faith No More, however, declined in popularity in the subsequent years. Longtime guitarist Jim Martin left the group in 1994 and was replaced by Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. After the release of their next album King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime, Spruance was replaced briefly by Dean Menta, who would eventually be replaced by their current guitarist Jon Hudson. After releasing one more album Album of the Year, Faith No More broke up in April 1998, and all members began work on side projects.<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_No_More\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Read more on Wikipedia.</a>",

First associated with the late 1970s punk movement, the band's music has evolved through numerous stylistic changes, often concurrently with changes in the group's membership. The Fall's music is often characterised by repetition, an abrasive guitar-driven sound, and is always underpinned by Smith's often cryptic lyrics, described by critic Steve Huey as \"abstract poetry filled with complicated wordplay, bone-dry wit, cutting social observations, and general misanthropy.\"\nThe group's output is prolific&#8212;as of November 2011 they have released 29 studio albums, and more than triple that counting live albums and other releases. They have never achieved widespread public success beyond a handful of minor hit singles in the late 1980s, but have maintained a strong cult following. The band were long associated with BBC disc jockey John Peel, who championed them from early on in their career and cited The Fall</p>",

Their first album, Crazy Rhythms (Stiff Records, 1980) was cited by R.E.M. as a major influence. Several bands have in turn influenced the Feelies, including The Velvet Underground and Lou Reed.

Fischer-Z&#39;s first hit was &quot;The Worker&quot; from the album Word Salad which firmly established Watts&#39; ability to convey worldly political issues in narrative songs against a background of quirky pop and reggae-influenced music.

Several songs on the album Red Skies Over Paradise in 1981, such as &quot;Berlin&quot; and &quot;Red Skies Over Paradise&quot; were about the Cold War and the song &quot;Cruise Missiles&quot; was about the nuclear arms race and the mutual threat of the superpowers with nuclear war.

Pierce, Tristan and Dunning were good friends having met at various early punk gigs and frequented the Capitol Records parking lot record swapmeet. Pierce played guitar and lead vocals, while Tristan took on lead guitar, Snowden on bass, and Dunning rounding out the quartet on drums. The band was originally a rockabilly band called The Cyclones led by Pleasant Gehman on lead vocals, but Gehman departed</p>",

He grew up in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\nHurley's debut album, First Songs, was recorded for Folkways Records in 1964 on the same reel-to-reel machine that taped Lead Belly's Last Sessions. He was discovered by blues and jazz historian Frederick Ramsey III, and subsequently championed by boyhood friend Jesse Colin Young, who released his 2nd &amp; 3rd albums on The Youngbloods' Warner Bros. imprint, Raccoon. In the late 1970s, Hurley made three albums for Rounder, all of which have since been reissued on CD. His 1976 LP Have Moicy, a collaboration with the Unholy Modal Rounders and Jeffrey Frederick &amp; The Clamtones, was named \"the greatest folk album of the rock era\" by The Village Voice's Robert Christgau.\nIn 1996, Koch Records released Wolfways with Hurley backed by Mickey Bones on drums. Tours with Son Volt and high praise from younger performers like Lucinda Williams, Vic Chesnutt, Woods, Calexico, Cat Power, Julian Lynch, and Robin Holcomb followed.\nIn 2001, Locust Music reissued Hurley's debut under the new title Blueberry Wine with new artwork contributed by</p>",

The band's continual members were guitarist Bob Mould, bassist Greg Norton, and drummer Grant Hart.\nH&#252;sker D&#252; first gained notice as a hardcore punk band with thrashing tempos and screamed vocals. The band developed a more melodic musical style as they drifted away from their early sound, helping to develop the early alternative rock sound in the process. Mould and Hart split the songwriting and singing duties; Mould's lyrics were known for being more soul-searching and intense than the often whimsical and cryptic ones of Hart.\nFollowing a series of albums on independent label SST Records, including Zen Arcade (1984) and New Day Rising (1985), the band signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1986. H&#252;sker D&#252; broke up in 1987 without having achieved a popular breakthrough, but they influenced later pop punk and alternative rock bands.\nMould released two solo albums before forming a similar band, Sugar, in the early 1990s; Hart released a solo album on SST, and later formed a band, Nova Mob.

Fronted by lead singer Jay Kay, Jamiroquai were initially the most prominent component in the early-1990s London-based acid jazz movement, alongside groups such as Incognito, the James Taylor Quartet, and the Brand New Heavies. Other Acid Jazz artists such as 'Moses Mayes' and Groove Collective are popular comparisons. Subsequent albums have explored other musical directions such as pop, rock and electronica. Their best known track is \"Virtual Insanity\", which won four awards at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards. Jamiroquai have sold more than 40 million albums worldwide and won a Grammy Award in 1998.\nThe band name is a portmanteau of \"jam session\" and \"iroquai\", based on the Iroquois, a Native American tribe. The original band was Jay Kay (vocals), Toby Smith (keyboard), Stuart Zender (bass), Nick Van Gelder (drums) and Wallis Buchanan (didgeridoo). These are the founding members of Jamiroquai and were involved in the writing and production of the first album. The lineup of the band has changed several times, and the longest serving and now core members of the band are lead singer and songwriter</p>",

Their initial farewell tour launched the first Lollapalooza festival, an alternative rock showcase. As a result, Jane's Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the \"Alternative Nation.\" The band was ranked 35th on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list.\nJane's Addiction formed out of the remains of frontman Perry Farrell's previous band, Psi Com.

When he graduated high school, and left to attend the University of Kansas, in Lawrence, Kansas, he immersed himself in the new wave music scene. By 1985, with some songs he'd recorded on a four-track recorder he moved to New York City. After a few years there, he signed with Bar None Records, and debuted just two tracks called Time for a Change, in 1989, and his first album was released in 1990, titled The Trouble</p>",

Malone writes, \"For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.\"\nThroughout his long career, Jones made headlines often as much for tales of his drinking, stormy relationships with women, and violent rages as for his prolific career of making records and touring. His wild lifestyle led to Jones missing many performances, earning him the nickname \"No Show Jones.\" With the help of his fourth wife, Nancy, he has been sober for over 10 years. Jones has had more than 150 hits during his career, both as a solo artist and in duets with other artists.

The band's line-up (centred on guitarist Robert Fripp) has persistently altered throughout their existence, with eighteen musicians and two lyricists passing through the ranks; though a greater degree of stability was achieved later in their history, with Adrian Belew having been a consistent member since 1981.\nThe debut line-up of the band was influential but short-lived, lasting for just over one year. Between 1970 and 1971, King Crimson were an unstable band, with many personnel changes and disjunctions between studio and live sound as they explored</p>",

Because Nora Ella was too poor to raise her son, King was raised by his maternal grandmother Elnora Farr in Kilmichael, Mississippi. Over the years, B.B. has developed one of the world's most identifiable guitar styles.

He didn't have much success in the charts following the scandal until his popularity recovered in the late '60s after making a career extension to country and western music with songs such as \"Another Place, Another Time\". More country hits soon followed over the late 1960s and through the 1970s. Lewis's successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as \"Chantilly Lace\" and \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century Lewis continues to tour to audiences around the world and still releases new albums one of which, titled Last Man Standing is his best selling to date at over a million copies sold worldwide.\nLewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been</p>",

Born in Bay City, Michigan, she moved to New York City in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups Breakfast Club and Emmy, she released her debut album in 1983. She followed it with a series of albums that attained immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Throughout her career, many of her songs have hit number one on the record charts, including \"Like a Virgin\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Vogue\", \"Frozen\", \"Music\", \"Hung Up\", and \"4 Minutes\". Critics have praised Madonna for her diverse musical productions while at the same time serving as a lightning rod for religious controversy.\nHer career was further enhanced by film appearances that began in 1979, despite mixed commentary.

The band is often also cited as being recognizable by Merrit's lyrics, often about love and often with irregular or neutral gender roles, that are by turns ironic, tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and humorous.\nThe band released their debut and best known single \"100,000 Fireflies\" in 1991, which was typical of the band's earlier career characterized by synthesized instrumentation by Merritt with lead vocals provided by Susan Anway (and then by Stephin Merrit himself from The Charm of the Highway Strip onwards).

The band is named after the album Master of Reality by Black Sabbath. The band&#39;s music has touched on many styles, ranging from hard rock to blues, from progressive rock to Beatlesque pop music. Frontman Goss is also a notable producer (Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age, UNKLE, Soulwax, Melissa Auf der Maur, The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster) and has contributed to many other bands in the Palm Desert Scene and beyond. After its first incarnation - which consisted of Chris Goss, Tim Harrington, Vinnie Ludovico and Googe - ended following the release of the self-titled debut album in 1988 there has been a revolving door policy in which Goss remains the only constant. According to metallian.com, the band was initially called The Manson Family. In 1992, Goss and Googe resurfaced as Masters Of Reality with Sunrise on the Sufferbus. Joined by drummer Ginger",

Their second album, Mad Season, released in 2000, charted in the top three on the Billboard 200 and was certified 4&times; platinum in the United States. Their third album, More Than You Think You Are, released in 2002, was certified double platinum in the United States. However, it was not as successful as the previous two albums, despite its singles receiving significant airplay. Director Bill Draheim documented the band throughout the process while making &quot;More Than You think You Are&quot;. The documentary &#39;Theresville&quot; was an online extra. The band then went on hiatus in 2004, with rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor leaving the band in 2005 after performing on the first three studio albums. As a result, Paul Doucette took over rhythm guitar, and the band reunited and released a compilation album, Exile on Mainstream, in 2007, which was certified gold in the United States. After the release, former Push Stars drummer Ryan MacMillan filled Doucette&#39;s vacated drum spot. During this period, Rob Thomas embarked on a successful solo career. Matchbox Twenty then took another hiatus, but reunited again in 2010.

The band has since released 13 studio albums, three live albums, two EPs, 26 singles, 32 music videos, four compilations, and one box set. A pioneer of the American thrash metal movement, Megadeth rose to international fame in the 1980s and was ranked as one of the \"Big Four of Thrash\" along with Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax, who were responsible for creating, developing and popularizing the thrash metal sub-genre.\nMegadeth's lineup has been changed numerous times, due partly to the band's notorious substance abuse problems. Mustaine and Ellefson are the only original members present in the current lineup (as of September 2011), and Mustaine is the only member who has been present throughout. After finding sobriety and securing a stable line-up, Megadeth went on to release a string of platinum and gold albums, including the platinum-selling landmark Rust in Peace in 1990, and the Grammy nominated, multi-platinum Countdown to Extinction in 1992.\nMegadeth</p>",

The band is often considered a precursor to or one of the earliest members of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Usually a power trio, Mot&#246;rhead had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Mot&#246;rhead's reputation as one of Britain's foremost rock bands.\nMot&#246;rhead are typically classified as heavy metal, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Mot&#246;rhead's approach has remained the same over the band's career, preferring to play what they enjoy and do best; their appreciation of early rock and roll is reflected in some of their occasional cover songs. Mot&#246;rhead's lyrics typically cover such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name</p>",

Their music incorporated recognizable elements of jazz, surf, classical, heavy metal, grindcore, country, punk rock and other genres.\nIn Naked City's characteristic early style, songs were often performed at astonishingly fast tempos, drawing heavily on thrash metal and hardcore punk's emphasis on extreme speed. Many songs were quite brief, and typically switched musical genres every few measures. One critic described Naked City's music as \"jump-cutting micro-collages of hardcore, country, sleazy jazz, covers of John Barry and Ornette Coleman, brief abstract tussles &#8212; a whole city crammed into two or three minute bursts\".

During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player.

The self-titled debut album Novastar was not released until four years later, in 2000, but with success. The album was released by Warner Music, reached #1 of the Ultratop Chart in Flanders and Novastar was awarded a platinum record. Singles Wrong, The Best Is Yet to Com, Caramia and Lost and Blown Away received much airplay. Novastar was honored as best album at both the Zamu Music Awards and the TMF Awards. Joost Zweegers intended to record his second album in the United States, but unhappy with the way he was pushed to produce hits, he returned to Belgium. He started a collaboration with the Belgian musician Ozark Henry and together they wrote the songs for the next Novastar album Another Lonely Soul. The album, which Ozark Henry also produced, was released in 2004. Although Joost Zweegers described Another Lonely Soul as &quot;more emotional and less suited for the radio&quot;, the album was an immediate success.",

The band's music, a rollicking blend of everything from stomping rockabilly to Beatles-influenced pop to Thelonious Monk-inspired jazz, has attracted fans as diverse as Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, Keith Richards and Penn and Teller. NRBQ songs have inspired cover versions by Bonnie Raitt, Los Lobos, and Dave Edmunds, among many others.

The original lineup consisted of Arabian Prince, DJ Yella, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, and MC Ren; Arabian Prince embarked on a solo career in 1989 and Ice Cube left in December of that year over royalty disputes. Several members would later become platinum-selling solo artists in the 1990s. Their debut album Straight Outta Compton marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era as the production and social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre. The group was assembled by Compton-based Eazy-E, who co-founded Ruthless Records with Jerry Heller. Initially, N.W.A consisted of Eazy-E and Dr. Dre, who in turn brought DJ Yella on board.

McCluskey then retained the OMD name and continued to record and tour as OMD with new line-ups through 1996.\nAlthough McCluskey essentially retired the OMD name in 1996, shortly thereafter Humphreys began playing live shows as OMD with other musicians on an as-needed basis, but without McCluskey. Then in late December 2005, OMD's official website announced a forthcoming reformation of the \"classic\" 1980's line-up (Humpheys/McCluskey/Cooper/Holmes), both for live performances and for a new studio album.

This resulted in the recording sessions for The Great Southern Trendkill to be held separately. The ongoing tensions lasted for another seven years, in which only one studio album, Reinventing the Steel was released.

His innovative approach to music exercised enormous influence on his contemporaries. Parker introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas, including rapidly passing chords, new variants of altered chords and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Many Parker recordings demonstrate virtuosic technique and complex melodic lines, combining jazz with other musical genres, including blues, Latin and classical.\r\nParker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later, the Beat Generation, personifying the jazz</p>",

Collectively the group has existed under various names since the 1960s and has been known for top-notch musicianship, politically charged lyrics, outlandish concept albums and memorable live performances. They influenced numerous post-disco and post-punk music groups of the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe collective's origins date back to the doo-wop group The Parliaments, formed in the late 1950s in Plainfield, New Jersey. Under Clinton's direction, by the early 1970s the groups Parliament and Funkadelic were operating concurrently and consisted of the same stable of musicians playing different types of funk music for two different labels. The name \"Parliament-Funkadelic\" became the catch-all term for the multiple bands in Clinton's stable. By the late 1970s the collective had grown to include dozens of musicians recording and touring under many different group names and solo projects. (See P-Funk offshoot groups and solo ventures.) Overall, the collective achieved thirteen top ten hits in the American R&amp;B music charts between 1967 and 1983, including six number one</p>",

His career, though short, is described by Allmusic as \"enormously influential\" for both country and rock, \"blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other.\"\nBorn in 1946, Parsons emerged from a wealthy but troubled childhood to attend Harvard University. He founded the International Submarine Band in 1966, and after several months of delay their debut, Safe at Home, was released in 1968, by which time the group had disbanded. Parsons joined The Byrds in early 1968, and played a pivotal role in the making of the seminal Sweetheart of the Rodeo album.

The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and are generally regarded as one of the first New Wave groups to achieve mainstream success, playing a style of rock that was influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz. Their 1983 album, Synchronicity, was number one on both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200, and sold over 8,000,000 copies in the US. The group disbanded in 1986, but reunited in early 2007 for a one-off world tour lasting until August 2008. The Police have sold more than 50 million albums worldwide, and were the world's highest-earning musicians in 2008, thanks to their reunion tour.\nThe Police were founded by American expatriate Stewart Copeland in early 1977. After the demise of his progressive rock band Curved Air, Copeland was eager to form a new three-piece group and join the burgeoning London punk scene. Singer-bassist Sting (Gordon Sumner) and guitarist Henry Padovani began rehearsing with Copeland in January 1977, and they recorded the first Police</p>",

Guitarist Michael Wilton and drummer Scott Rockenfield were members of a band called Cross+Fire, who covered songs from popular heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Before long Cross+Fire added guitarist Chris DeGarmo and bassist Eddie Jackson to their lineup, and changed their name to The Mob. The Mob, who were without a singer, recruited Geoff Tate to sing for them at a local rock festival. At the time, Tate was already in a band called Babylon. After Babylon broke up Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal.\nIn 1981, The Mob put together sufficient funds to record a demo tape.

The band took their name from a misheard lyric from the Stooges' song \"1970\" (the actual lyric is \"radio burnin'\").\nAfter being rejected many times from various venues, Radio Birdman found a pub in Taylor Square, Sydney and eventually took over its management, naming it The Oxford Funhouse.

She has cited Van Morrison and Miles Davis as being strong creative influences.\nSiberry has often criticized the competitive power of commercial radio and the recording industry. In 2005, Siberry pioneered a self-determined pricing policy through her website on which the purchaser is given the choices of: standard price (about $0.99 USD/track); pay now, self-priced; pay later, self-priced; or \"a gift from Jane\".

Their final two albums, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock, were highly acclaimed and remain influential to experimental alternative rock genres, especially post-rock.\nTalk Talk began as a quartet consisting of Mark Hollis (vocals), Simon Brenner (keyboards), Lee Harris (drums) and Paul Webb (bass guitar). In their early years, they were generally associated with the New Romantic movement; more specifically, they were often compared with Duran Duran, as both bands sported a name which was a single word repeated, a Roxy Music-inspired musical direction, and shared the same record label (EMI) and producer (Colin Thurston).

During this time, both began punching each other's teeth out, leading to the distinctive \"warbly\" vocal style that both have. Both moved to New York, separately, in the early 1970s, aspiring to be poets.\nTheir first group together was the Neon Boys, consisting of Verlaine on guitar and vocals, Hell on bass and vocals, and Billy Ficca on drums.

His debut album Maxinquaye was nominated for the Mercury Prize and voted Album of the Year by NME Magazine.\r\nTricky was born in Knowle West, Bristol, England to a Jamaican father and a mixed-race Ghanaian-English mother. His father left the family before he was born and his mother, Maxine Quaye, committed suicide when he was only four. He named his solo album after her - Maxinquaye - and once said that though he hardly knew her, he feels like she's speaking through him with his words.\r\nHe spent his youth in the care of his grandmother, who often let him watch old horror movies instead of going to school. At 15 he began to write lyrics (\"I like to rock, I like to dance, I like pretty girls taking down their pants\" MixMag 1996).

Shakur began his career as a roadie, backup dancer, and MC for the alternative hip hop group Digital Underground. Both of his parents and several other of his family members were members of the Black Panther Party. Shakur was involved in an East Coast–West Coast rivalry after a major feud with East Coast rappers, producers and record-label staff members, most notably The Notorious B.I.G. and Bad Boy Records. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot multiple times in a drive-by shooting at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada.

This line-up did not last long, and Van den Berg then hired Bert Heerink (vocals), Dick Kemper (bass guitar), and Jos Zoomer (drums). With this line-up, Teaser recorded a demo that came to the notice of the pop-journalist Kees Baars. Baars offered to manage the group, and contracted the band at Atlantic Records in the U.S.. Their first album, Vandenberg, was recorded at the former Led Zeppelin&#39;s guitarist Jimmy Page&#39;s studio, Sol Studios, and in 1983 their first single, &quot;Burning Heart&quot;. reached No. 39 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 charts. Vandenberg toured the U.S. as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne and KISS, and toured independently in Japan in 1984. &quot;Different Worlds&quot; from their second album, Heading For A Storm, also did fairly well, but did not equal the success of &quot;Burning Heart&quot;. The band&#39;s third album, Alibi, was recorded in the Netherlands, produced by Jaap Eggermont, manager of the Golden Earring. The album failed",

The band explored the complete range of phonaesthetics from euphony to cacophony, often within the same song. Van der Graaf Generator albums tended to be darker in atmosphere than many of their prog-rock peers (a trait they shared with King Crimson, whose guitarist Robert Fripp guested on two of their albums), and guitar solos were the exception rather than the rule.\nHammill is the primary songwriter for the band, and the line between music written for his solo career and for the band is sometimes blurred.

Nevertheless, their first single, \"Oh Bondage, Up Yours!\", is now acknowledged as a classic punk rock single and the album, Germfree Adolescents, is widely acclaimed as a classic album of the punk rock genre.\nInitially, the band featured singer Poly Styrene (born Marianne Joan Elliott-Said) on vocals, Jak Airport (Jack Stafford) on guitars, Paul Dean on bass, Paul 'B. P.' Hurding on drums, and Lora Logic (born Susan Whitby) on saxophone. This latter instrument was an atypical addition to the standard punk instrumental line-up, and became one of the group's most distinctive features.\nX-Ray Spex's other distinctive musical element was Poly Styrene's voice, which has been variously described as \"effervescently discordant\" and \"powerful enough to drill holes through sheet metal\".

In their second year of studies, Joe showed Gwil a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Gwil acting as producer on GarageBand.

She came to greater prominence in 1967 as a featured performer on singer Porter Wagoner&#39;s weekly television program; their first duet single, a cover of Tom Paxton&#39;s &quot;The Last Thing on My Mind&quot;, was a top-ten hit on the country singles charts, and led to several successful albums before they ended their partnership in 1974. Moving towards mainstream pop music, Parton&#39;s 1977 single &quot;Here You Come Again&quot; was a success on both the country and pop charts. A string of pop-country hits followed into the mid-1980s, the most successful being her 1981 hit 9 to 5&quot; (from the film of the same name), and her 1983 duet with Kenny Rogers &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, both of which topped the U.S. pop and country singles charts. A pair of albums recorded with Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris were among her later successes. In the late 1990s, Parton returned to classic country/bluegrass with a series of acclaimed recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-musical ventures include the creation of Dollywood, a theme park in the Smokey Mountains in Tennessee, and her efforts on behalf of childhood literacy, particularly her Imagination Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has composed over 3,000 songs, the best known of which include &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper for Parton, as well as an international pop hit for Whitney Houston), &quot;Jolene&quot;, &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot;,&quot;9 to 5&quot;, and &quot;My Tennessee Mountain Home&quot;.

Since then, the band have released a total of ten studio albums, four EPs, three compilations, three box sets, one live album and one covers album. After releasing two studio albums in 1990 and 1991, respectively, Iced Earth took a three year layoff, from 1992 to 1995, after which the band returned with new lead vocalist Matt Barlow. Iced Earth went on to release four studio albums with Barlow, between 1995 and 2001 respectively; 1995&#39;s Burnt Offerings, 1996&#39;s The Dark Saga, 1998&#39;s Something Wicked This Way Comes and 2001&#39;s Horror Show. After Horror Show, Barlow quit the band and joined the police force, while Iced Earth continued on with Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, of Judas Priest-fame, on vocals. With Owens, the band released two studio albums, until late 2007, when it was announced that Matt Barlow would be rejoining the band, after five years apart.

After a spell advising the New York Dolls in the US, McLaren managed the Sex Pistols, to whom he recruited the nihilistic frontman Johnny Rotten. The issue of a controversial record, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, satirising the Queen&#39;s Jubilee was typical of McLaren&#39;s shock-tactics, and he gained publicity by being arrested after a promotional boat trip outside the Houses of Parliament. McLaren also performed as a solo artist, initially popularizing hip hop and world music and later diversifying into funk and disco, the dance fashion for &quot;vogueing&quot; and merging opera with contemporary electronic musical forms.</p>\r\n",

Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band&#39;s future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return.</p>\r\n",

During their eleven years at Sony, 1993&ndash;2004, they notched up 11 Top 40 UK singles with three Top 10s, and had a chart presence worldwide. The name comes from the Greek god Apollo and the frequency of concert pitch &mdash; the A note at 440 Hz, often denoted as &quot;A440&quot;, and the Sequential Circuits sampler/sequencer, the Studio 440. They changed the writing of their name from Apollo 440 to Apollo Four Forty in 1996, though they switched back for their latest album. To date Apollo&#39;s remixes number around 60 - from U2 in the early 1990s to Puff Daddy/Jimmy Page and Ennio Morricone a decade later. Apollo&#39;s version of Puretone&#39;s &quot;Addicted To Bass&quot; was made a lead track and became a hit in 2002.

To date, the band has released ten full-length studio albums, one live album, two EPs and one DVD. Although their first two studio albums were critically acclaimed, Pennywise would not experience worldwide commercial success until the 1995 release of their third studio album, About Time, which peaked at number ninety-six on the Billboard 200, and number fifty-five on Australia&#39;s ARIA Charts. The band&#39;s mainstream success was signified by a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands NOFX, Rancid, Blink-182, Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring and Sublime. By 2007, the band had independently sold over 3 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent punk acts of all time. Pennywise&#39;s current line-up consists of Jim Lindberg, Fletcher Dragge, Randy Bradbury and Byron McMackin. They had kept their original line-up together until bassist Jason Thirsk committed suicide in 1996, due to issues with his alcoholism, after which Bradbury joined as his replacement. In August 2009, Lindberg decided to leave the band; he was replaced in February 2010 by Ignite singer Zoli T&eacute;gl&aacute;s. With T&eacute;gl&aacute;s, the band recorded their tenth studio album All or Nothing, which was released on May 1, 2012.

In 1987, Siepen joined and Stauch returned; under this line-up, which lasted 18 years, the band changed their name to Blind Guardian and released their first album, Battalions of Fear, in 1988. Over the releases, Blind Guardian established themselves as a notable successful band and as pioneers of the power metal movement.

These compositions, marked by their use of repetitive figures, slow harmonic rhythm and canons, have significantly influenced contemporary music, especially in the US.

Scoring some 23 UK top 40 singles and 17 UK top 40 albums to date in a career spanning four decades, the Stranglers are one of the longest-surviving and most &quot;continuously successful&quot; band to have originated in the UK punk scene of the mid to late 1970s. Beginning life as the Guildford Stranglers on 11 September 1974 in Guildford, Surrey, they originally built a following within the mid-1970s pub rock scene. While their aggressive, no-compromise attitude identified them as one of the instigators of the UK punk rock scene that followed, their idiosyncratic approach rarely followed any single musical genre and the group went on to explore a variety of musical styles, from new wave, art rock and gothic rock through the sophisticated pop of some of their 1980s output. They had major mainstream success with their single &quot;Golden Brown&quot;. Their other hits include &quot;No More Heroes&quot;, &quot;Peaches&quot;, &quot;Always the Sun&quot; and &quot;Skin Deep&quot;. The Stranglers&#39; early sound was driven by Jean-Jacques Burnel&#39;s melodic bass, but also gave prominence to Dave Greenfield&#39;s keyboards at a time when the instrument was seen as unfashionable. Their early music was also characterised by the growling vocals and sometimes misanthropic lyrics of both Jean-Jacques Burnel and Hugh Cornwell. Over time, their output gradually grew more refined and sophisticated. Summing up their contribution to popular music, critic Dave Thompson later wrote: &quot;From bad-mannered yobs to purveyors of supreme pop delicacies, the group was responsible for music that may have been ugly and might have been crude &ndash; but it was never, ever boring.&quot;</p>\r\n",
